               Custody generally: The committee on city property shall have the custody of all surplus real and personal
               property. The committee may, in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B,
               sell, rent or acquire any such property.

               (b)

               Procedures for selling or renting real property or any interest therein: Whenever the committee on city property shall determine to sell or rent real property
               or any interest therein owned by the city, it shall proceed in the following way:

               (1)

               At least seven (7) days prior to the vote to sell or rent the committee shall notify
               the head of each city department of the proposed sale or rental. Prior to voting on
               any such sale or rental the committee shall hear all interested parties with regard
               to whether such real property is needed for municipal purposes. If, after such hearing,
               the committee determines that the property in question is not needed for municipal
               purposes, it shall then vote as to whether or not it shall offer the property for
               sale or rental.

               (2)

               After a vote to sell or rent such real property or interest therein, the committee
               chairperson shall commission a real estate broker licensed under the provisions of
               M.G.L.A. c. 112, § 87PP, to submit a sealed appraisal of the fair market value of
               the real property or the fair rental value as the case may be, in question within
               fourteen (14) days of the date of such commission. The choice of a broker shall be
               made on a rotating basis from a list maintained by the committee of licensed brokers
               residing or doing business in the city who have requested to be placed on said list.
               The manner in which the list shall be maintained and the method and amount of compensation
               of the brokers shall be determined by regulations adopted by the committee. If the
               fair market value of the real estate or the fair market value of the rental does not
               exceed the value contained in M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16(c)(2), then it shall not be mandatory
               to solicit proposals under this section.

               (3)

               After the committee has made a determination as to whether or not it shall proceed
               to sell or rent real property or any interest therein, then the committee chairman
               shall sell or rent such property by soliciting proposals in accordance with the applicable
               provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16, as amended, where applicable. The committee chairperson
               shall schedule a meeting for the purpose of receiving proposals upon the property
               in question at the time and place designated in the advertisement which shall not
               be later than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date upon which the committee
               has voted to sell or rent.

               (4)

               A minimum two-thirds (⅔) vote of all of the members of the city council shall be necessary
               to approve sale or rental of such real property.

               (c)

               Procedures for acquisition or rental of real property:

               (1)

               Whenever the committee on city property shall determine by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of
               all of the members of the committee on city property to acquire by purchase or rental
               real property or any interest therein it shall do so only in accordance with the provisions
               of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16, as amended, where applicable.

               (2)

               After a minimum two-thirds (⅔) vote of all the members of the committee on city property
               to acquire by purchase or rental such real property or any interest therein, the committee
               chairperson shall commission a real estate broker licensed under the provisions of
               M.G.L.A. c. 112, § 87PP, to submit a sealed appraisal of the fair market value of
               the real property or the fair rental value as the case may be, in question within
               fourteen (14) days of the date of such commission. The choice of a broker shall be
               made on a rotating basis from a list maintained by the committee of licensed brokers
               residing in the city who have requested to be placed on said list. The manner in which
               the list shall be maintained and the method and amount of compensation of the brokers
               shall be determined by regulations adopted by the committee. If the fair market value
               of the real estate or the fair market value of the rental does not exceed the value
               contained in M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16(c)(2), then it shall not be mandatory to solicit
               proposals under this section.

               (3)

               After the committee has made a determination as to whether or not it shall proceed
               to sell or rent real property or any interest therein, then the committee chairman
               shall sell or rent such property in accordance with the applicable provisions of M.G.L.A.
               c. 30B, § 16, as amended. The committee chairperson shall schedule a meeting for the
               purpose of receiving bids upon the property in question at the time and place designated
               in the advertisement which shall not be later than one hundred twenty (120) days from
               the date upon which the committee has voted to sell or rent.

               (4)

               A two-thirds (⅔) vote of all of the members of the city council shall be necessary
               to approve acquisition or rental of such real property.

               (d)

               Procedures for disposal of certain personal property:

               (1)

               The city council shall dispose of surplus property which has resale or salvage value
               which is equal to or exceeds the dollar amount provided at M.G.L.A c. 30B, § 15(f)
               only in accordance with the terms of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 15, as amended.

               (2)

               The committee shall sell said property through competitive sealed bids, public auctions
               or established markets, the time and place of the auction to be advertised in a local
               newspaper in conformity with subsection 10-63(c) of the Code. As a condition precedent to the commencement of any public auction,
               transfer or sale, the committee shall hear all interested parties with regard to the
               question of whether any property to be auctioned, transferred or sold is needed for
               municipal purposes, and shall vote that such surplus personal property is not needed
               for municipal purposes.

               (3)

               Notwithstanding the provisions above mentioned in regard to public auction, if a number
               of similar items are declared surplus personal property, the committee, at its discretion,
               may dispose of said property by direct sale to the public at established market prices;
               provided, however, the same procedures regarding advertisement, hearings and vote
               as for public auctions, are followed. The time, place and manner for holding such
               transfer auction or sale shall be determined by the committee.

               (4)

               If the committee rejects the bid of the highest responsive bidder, the committee may:

               (i)

               Negotiate a sale of such supply so long as the negotiated price is higher than the
               bid price; or

               (ii)

               Resolicit bids.

               (5)

               The purchasing agent or delegated procurement officer under section 10-54 may be authorized to trade in a supply listed for trade-in in the invitation for
               bids or request for proposals.

               (6)

               For personal property with an estimated net value of less than five thousand dollars
               ($5,000.00), the purchasing agent shall dispose of such property using written procedures
               approved by the city council and mayor.

               (7)

               Notwithstanding any other requirement of this section, the city council may, by majority
               vote, unless otherwise prohibited by law, dispose of a tangible supply or personal
               property no longer useful to the city but having resale or salvage value, at less
               than the fair market value to a charitable organization which has received a tax exemption
               from the United States by reason of its charitable nature.

               (e)

               The committee on city property shall investigate and report its recommendations to
               the city council on all matters referred to it relating to request for streets, sewers,
               the proper maintenance thereof, and such other pertinent or allied subjects. It shall
               have authority to determine, without need to report to the city council, the location
               of lights and the form thereof and shall see that all contracts for street lighting
               in which the city is a party are properly performed. The assistant wire inspector
               shall act in an advisory capacity to the committee on matters relative to streetlights.
               The committee shall review all petitions for the installation of sidewalks or sewer
               service under the betterment law and all related matters.

               (f)

               The committee on city property shall compile and maintain an inventory of all objects
               of historical value owned by or in the custody of the city or any department thereof.
               It shall be the custodian of all papers, documents, antiques, works of art, and their
               memorabilia of historical value hereafter acquired by the city by gift, purchase,
               grant, devise, or agreement pertaining to personal property and shall manage the same.

               [Methods.] The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property through the abutter
               lots program, or through public auctions, to be held on a semiannual basis, or in
               accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.A., c. 30B, or through transferring to the
               city property committee those parcels, which are to be maintained by the city for
               municipal purposes and for which the treasurer has received notice.

               (b)

               Definitions. [The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed
               to them in this subsection:]

               Abutter lots program means a program developed to provide an abutting landowner with the first opportunity
               to acquire an abutting parcel foreclosed for tax title. Regulations for the program
               shall be promulgated and periodically published by the city treasurer.

               Decrees of foreclosure means a decree issued by the Land Court Department of the Trial Court of Massachusetts,
               which forever bars all rights of redemption (M.G.L.A. c. 60, § 69).

               Foreclosed tax title property means property for which the city has obtained a decree of foreclosure from the Land
               Court Department of the Trial Court of Massachusetts.

               Parcel eligible for abutter lots program means a parcel for which a decree of foreclosure has been obtained by the treasurer,
               which contains less than the minimum square footage requirement for a buildable lot,
               is located adjacent to a privately owned building on at least one side, is not needed
               for public open space or other public use, and is not part of a larger vacant parcel
               which will be developed. Abutter lots may be used only for a garden, side yard, landscaped
               open space, off-street parking, garage, or addition to abutter's existing structure.

               (c)

               Property eligible for abutter lots program. The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property eligible for the
               abutter lots program in the following manner:

               (1)

               Within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer receives the decree
               of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the mayor, city council
               and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel of property. The
               letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location of the property and
               shall further state that the parcel will be placed into the abutter lots program unless
               the treasurer receives written notification, within thirty (30) days from the date
               the treasurer's communication appears on the city council agenda, that the mayor,
               city council or city department has a need for the parcel. Control of all parcels
               needed for a municipal purpose, which are to be maintained in the possession of the
               city as municipal property, shall be turned over to the city property committee.

               (2)

               After the thirty-day period has expired, the treasurer shall send a notice to the
               owner of record immediately prior to the acquisition by the city of the title to such
               property. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold sufficient
               to identify it, shall state that the property has been placed in the abutter lots
               program, and shall state the date, time and place appointed for the sale thereof and
               the terms and conditions of such sale, and shall be sent by certified mail, return
               receipt requested, to the address of such owner, as appearing upon the records of
               the assessors of the city, at least fourteen (14) days before the sale. The treasurer
               shall also, not less than fourteen (14) days before such sale date, post a similar
               notice in two (2) or more convenient and public places in the city. The treasurer
               may reject any and all bids at such sale or any adjournment thereof if, in his opinion,
               no bid qualifies under the request for proposal. After any such sale and upon payment
               by the purchaser to the city of the amount of a bid accepted by the treasurer, the
               treasurer on behalf of the city, shall execute and deliver any instrument necessary
               to transfer the title of the city to any such property sold under this section. The
               deed shall contain a covenant, running with the land, limiting future use of the property
               to those uses permitted under the abutter lots program. The treasurer shall not execute
               any deeds for tax title property until the purchaser submits to the treasurer a statement
               signed under the pains and penalties of perjury that neither he nor any person who
               would gain equity in the property as a result of such conveyance has ever been convicted
               of a crime involving the willful and malicious setting of a fire or of a crime involving
               the aiding, counseling or procuring of a willful and malicious setting of a fire,
               or of a crime involving the fraudulent filing of a claim of fire insurance; or is
               delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes to the city, or, if delinquent, that
               a pending application for abatement of such tax, or a pending petition before the
               appellate tax board or the county commissioners has been filed in good faith. If there
               is more than one grantee of such deed, each grantee must file such statement, and
               no such deed shall be valid unless it contains a recitation that the treasurer has
               received such statement. Said deed shall further contain a covenant, running with
               the land, requiring the purchaser to complete the clean up and reuse of the property
               proposed in their abutter's lot program application within one year of the date of
               transfer. Said one year time period may be extended for an additional six (6) months
               provided the purchaser has applied for any and all permits necessary to complete their
               proposed work. The city shall have the option in the deed, pursuant to the preceding
               covenants, to take the property back or to bring an action in equity to enforce the
               terms of the covenants.

               (3)

               All parcels included in the abutter lots program shall be offered for sale to qualified
               abutters, in accordance with the regulations governing the abutter lots program.

               (4)

               All parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between
               January 1 and June 30 shall be auctioned in the following September. All parcels for
               which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between July 1 and
               December 31 shall be auctioned in the following March.

               (5)

               If a parcel has not been disposed of after having been for the first time offered
               for sale through the abutter lots program, it shall then be disposed of in the same
               manner as tax title property which is not eligible for the abutter lots program. Notwithstanding
               the previous sentence, if the parcel has still not been disposed of, it may then be
               offered again through the abutter lots program, or any other method for disposition
               of such parcels contained in these ordinances.

               (6)

               Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a lot acquired through the abutter's
               lots program may be combined with an adjacent lot also acquired through the abutter
               lots program to form a ""combined lot."" Such combined lot shall not be subject to the
               restrictions set forth in the restrictive covenant and may then be developed in accordance
               with the relevant provisions of the city Code of Ordinances, provided that the combined
               lot satisfies then existing zoning, subdivision and building requirements without
               relief from the City Code sections regarding front yard, side yard, rear yard, floor-to-area
               ratios, lot size, density, or frontage. No other property may be considered as part
               of the combined lot in determining whether such combined lot satisfies the relevant
               sections of the City Code.

               (d)

               Property not eligible for abutter lot program. The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property, which is ineligible
               for the abutter lots program or which previously has been submitted for auction one
               time through the abutter lots program, and which the treasurer will not be transferring
               to the city property committee only in either of the following two (2) ways, at the
               option of the treasurer:

               (1)

               Auction.

               a.

               With exception of property which has previously been submitted for auction through
               the abutter lots program, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer
               receives the decree of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the
               mayor, city council and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel
               of property. The letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location
               of the property and shall further state that the parcel will be auctioned by the city
               treasurer unless the treasurer receives written notification, within thirty (30) days
               of said notice, that the mayor, city council or city department has a need for the
               parcel.

               b.

               The treasurer shall send a notice to the owner of record prior to the auction by the
               city of such property. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to
               be sold sufficient to identify it; shall state the date, time, and place appointed
               for the sale thereof and the terms and conditions of such sale; and shall be sent
               by registered mail to the address of such owner as appearing upon the records of the
               assessors of the city, at least fourteen (14) days before the auction date.

               c.

               In addition to the notice provisions of subsection (b) above, the treasurer shall
               also, not less than fourteen (14) days before such appointed date, post a notice of
               all property to be auctioned, in two (2) or more convenient and public places in the
               city, as well as in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

               d.

               The treasurer may reject any and all bids at such sale or any adjournment thereof
               if, in his opinion, no bid is made which approximates the fair market value of the
               property.

               e.

               After any such sale and upon payment by the purchaser to the city of the amount of
               a bid accepted by the treasurer, the treasurer, on behalf of the city, shall execute
               and deliver any instrument necessary to transfer the title of the city to any such
               property sold under this section. The treasurer shall not execute any deeds for tax
               title property until the purchaser submits to the treasurer a statement signed under
               the pains and penalties of perjury that neither he nor any person who would gain equity
               in the property as a result of such conveyance has ever been convicted of a crime
               involving the willful and malicious setting of a fire or of a crime involving the
               aiding, counseling or procuring of a willful and malicious setting of a fire, or of
               a crime involving the fraudulent filing of a claim of fire insurance; or is delinquent
               in the payment of real estate taxes to the city, or, if delinquent, that a pending
               application for abatement of such tax, or a pending petition before the appellate
               tax board or the county commissioner has been filed in good faith. If there is more
               than one grantee of such deed, each grantee must file such statement, and no such
               deed shall be valid unless it contains a recitation that the treasurer has received
               such statement.

               f.

               In the case of parcels to be offered at auction, parcels for which a decree of foreclosure
               has been received by the treasurer between January 1 and June 30, and all parcels
               remaining from the September abutter lots auction, shall be auctioned in the following
               October. All parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer
               between July 1 and December 31, and all parcels remaining from the March abutter lots
               auction shall be auctioned in the following April. Properties remaining after an auction
               would be re-advertised for successive auctions or offered under subsection 2-104(d)(2) until sold.

               Procedures for selling or renting real property or any interest therein - M.G.L.A.
                  c. 30B.

               a.

               The city treasurer may determine to sell or rent real property or any interest therein
               other than under the abutter lots program or at auction and shall do so only in accordance
               with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B.

               b.

               Within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer receives the decree
               of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the mayor, city council
               and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel of property. The
               letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location of the property and
               shall further state that the city will solicit proposals for selling or renting such
               property or any interests therein unless the treasurer receives written notification,
               within thirty (30) days of said notice, that the mayor, city council or city department
               has a need for the parcel.

               c.

               The treasurer shall send a notice to the parcel's owner of record at the same time
               as there is the first newspaper advertisement inviting the submission of proposals
               by the city. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold sufficient
               to identify it, and shall specify the geographical area, terms and requirements of
               the proposed transaction and the time and place for the submission of proposals.

               d.

               The city treasurer shall sell or rent such property by soliciting proposals in accordance
               with the applicable provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16, as amended and the purchasing
               agent as the city's chief procurement officer shall be responsible for compliance
               with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B.

               e.

               The purchasing agent, as chief procurement officer, may pursuant to the provisions
               of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 9, cancel an invitation for bids and request for proposals or
               may reject in whole or in part any and all bids or proposals when the purchasing agent
               determines that cancellation or rejection serves the best interests of the city.

               f.

               After any such sale and upon payment by the purchaser to the city of the amount of
               a bid accepted by the city, the treasurer, on behalf of the city, shall execute and
               deliver any instrument necessary to transfer the title of the city to any such property

               Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority of M.G.L.A. c. 60, § 62A, as amended,
               which authorizes municipalities to enact ordinances to authorize payment agreements
               between the city treasurer/collector and persons entitled to redeem parcels in tax
               title.

               (b)

               Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to foster the collection of unpaid taxes
               and assessments, promote residential stability and community reinvestment. The city
               finds and determines that such a program will mitigate the social cost and consequences
               of property seizures and will help delinquent taxpayers meet their obligations to
               the city while avoiding the legal expenses and time delays of taking the property
               to land court. During the term of any municipal tax repayment agreement the treasurer/collector
               may not bring an action to foreclose the tax title account unless the taxpayers fails
               to comply with the terms and conditions of the municipal tax repayment agreement.
               The forgiveness contained herein shall not be used in addition to any other forgiveness
               or deferral authorized by law.

               (c)

               Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall be applicable:

               Commercial taxpayer means the owner of record of an industrial or commercial use property or rental property
               of greater than three (3) rental units.

               Residential taxpayer means the owner of record of an residential property containing less than four (4)
               units.

               Tax repayment agreement means a payment agreement between the treasurer and the persons entitled to redeem
               parcels in tax title which tax title parcel(s) is (are) the subject of the agreement
               and which provides for payment in full, and includes residential tax repayment agreements
               and commercial tax repayment agreements.

               All agreements under this section shall be in writing, signed by the taxpayer and
               the treasurer, and shall include the amount due upon execution of the agreement and
               a schedule of remaining payments.

               (d)

               Residential tax repayment agreements.

               (1)

               Delinquent residential taxpayers may enter into a residential tax repayment agreement
               and, upon execution of such agreement with the city treasurer/collector, shall make
               a minimum payment of twenty-five (25) percent of the total amount necessary to redeem
               the parcel from tax title.

               (2)

               The term of a residential tax repayment agreement shall not exceed five (5) years
               for residential taxpayers. During the term of the residential tax repayment agreement
               the taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule
               and must remain current on all other amounts due the city (that are a lien on the
               same parcel or parcels).

               (e)

               Commercial tax repayment agreements.

               (1)

               Delinquent commercial taxpayers may enter into a commercial tax repayment agreement
               and, upon execution of such agreement with the city treasurer/collector, shall make
               a minimum payment of twenty-five (25) percent of the total amount necessary to redeem
               the parcel from tax title.

               (2)

               The term of a commercial tax repayment agreement shall not exceed five (5) years for
               commercial taxpayers. During the term of the commercial tax repayment agreement, the
               taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule
               and shall remain current on all other amounts due the city (that are a lien on the
               same parcel or parcels).

               (f)

               Tax repayment agreements, generally.

               (1)

               A taxpayer who enters into a tax repayment agreement in accordance with this section
               shall be granted a fifty (50) percent waiver of the interest that has accrued on the
               amount of the tax title account.

               (2)

               If the balance of the tax title account exceeds that parcel's assessed value as determined
               by the assessor's office as of the date of the agreement, then such parcel shall be
               granted a fifty (50) percent waiver of the interest that has accrued on the amount
               of the tax title account, regardless of the number of years such parcel has been in
               tax title. This waiver cannot reduce the total amount outstanding in the tax title
               account below one hundred ten (110) percent of the parcel's assessed value as determined
               by the assessor's office.

               (3)

               Partial payments or partial payment agreements are not eligible for interest waivers
               of any kind.

               (4)

               Calculation of the waiver of interest shall be made only after at least twenty-five
               (25) percent of the amount needed to redeem that parcel or parcel(s) from tax title
               is first paid to the treasurer.

               (5)

               For so long as such payment agreements are in effect with all payments having been
               made in the amounts and at the times provided by the schedule in said agreement, and
               for so long as the current assessed taxes and other charges are paid when due and
               in full, then the treasurer shall not bring an action to foreclose the tax title on
               such parcel.

               (6)

               Should the taxpayer default by failing to make payments under the agreement as provided
               in the schedule of remaining payments or should charges that are liens on the parcel(s)
               which is the subject of the agreement become delinquent, then the treasurer shall
               bring an action to foreclose the tax title on such parcel(s) and such agreement shall
               be null and void.

               (7)

               Interest waivers shall be granted only if and when the delinquent taxpayer has paid
               off the delinquency in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Taxes or collection
               costs may not be waived.

               to determine if the crime is related to a pattern of discrimination or if, due to

               Receive evidence and hear testimony related to bias crime, patterns of discrimination,
               and bias-related tensions.

               b.

               Compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to the
               matter in question, for investigatory and determinative purposes, by subpoena issued
               by the commission and enforce such subpoena in superior court.

               c.

               Issue findings and recommendations concerning ways in which bias crimes, discriminatory
               patterns and bias-related tensions can be reduced in the affected area.

               (4)

               The commission is hereby authorized to develop and initiate educational and other
               programs designed to reduce bias-related tensions and the incidence of bias crimes,

               similar nature shall be surrounded by concrete not less than three (3) inches in thickness.
               Single conduits or ducts of standard wrought iron or steel pipe with screw threads
               or approved couplings, or approved cable for services, may be laid directly in the
               ground; but a covering of wood, concrete or some other suitable material, at least
               two (2) inches thick, shall be placed over them to protect them from, mechanical injury
               by persons digging in the street or sidewalk. Treated wood duct, transits or other
               heavy-walled pipe may be laid without protective cover. When ducts cross under or
               over water or other pipes, care shall be taken that ducts and pipes do not come in
               contact with each other, and if close together, they shall be separated by a covering
               of wood, concrete or some other suitable material at least two (2) inches thick.

               The owner of a conduit shall provide means for effectively preventing the entrance
               or accumulation of gas therein whenever, in the judgment of the inspector of wires,
               public safety so requires.

               (j)

               All manholes shall be maintained in accordance with rules and regulations governing
               maintenance of manholes in public highways from time to time prescribed by the state
               board of fire prevention regulations, department of public safety. All manholes shall
               be kept clean, and clear of oily waste and rubbish of all kinds.

               (k)

               When a manhole is opened it shall be carefully examined for the presence of gas before
               any open or enclosed flame, or unextinguished cigarette, cigar or pipe is brought
               near the opening. If gas is found to be present, the manhole shall be effectively
               cleared of the same before any work is begun or any flame used. If the flow of gas
               into a manhole is so great as to prevent its proper ventilation, it shall not be entered
               until the place from which gas comes is found, and the leak stopped, or the source
               of supply cut off.

               (l)

               Every manhole and handhole cover shall permanently bear the name or initials of its
               owner by which it can be identified.

               (m)

               No person shall be allowed access to manholes or handholes except the authorized representatives
               of the inspector of wires, and those of the owners of said manholes and handholes
               or the ducts, cables and conductors entering the same.

               (n)

               When any manhole or handhole cover is removed or any excavation is made, the opening
               shall be protected promptly with a barrier, temporary cover, or other suitable guard;
               and danger signals or red lights shall be displayed in a location conspicuous to the
               traffic until a permanent cover is in place or the excavation is filled.

               For the purpose of overhead construction, electric conductors are divided into the
               following four (4) classes:

               (1)

               High-voltage supply system conductors.

               (2)

               Low-voltage supply system conductors.

               (3)

               Communication system conductors.

               (4)

               Intelligence communications.

               (b)

               A distance of forty (40) inches shall be maintained between supply system conductors
               and communication system conductors at points of attachment to the same pole.

               (c)

               Service drop wires shall not be smaller than number eight (8) American wire gauge.
               This minimum shall apply to each conductor of a multi-conductor cable.

               (d)

               All conductors shall have weatherproof or equivalent covering. The provisions of this
               subsection shall not apply to the following:

               (1)

               Supply system conductors carrying thirteen thousand two hundred (13,200) volts or
               more.

               (2)

               Neutral conductors of service drop cables.

               (3)

               Effectively grounded neutral conductors.

               (4)

               Span lengths in excess of two hundred (200) feet. Whenever in the opinion of the inspector
               of wires the covering of conductors becomes impaired or unsightly, the owner shall
               renew such covered wire without unnecessary delay.

               (e)

               All tie-wires shall have a covering similar to that of the conductors they confine.
               Bare conductors shall be tied with bare wire.

               (f)

               No supply system conductor smaller than number six (6) American wire gauge, shall
               be used for outside construction between poles or supporting fixtures, except in the
               case of cables supplying street lights.

               (g)

               Unguarded high-voltage conductors shall not be run within three (3) feet, nor low-voltage
               conductors within four (4) inches of any pole, building or any other structure without
               being securely attached thereto, and insulated therefrom.

               (h)

               If any portion of a street light fixture or other part of supply system equipment
               can be touched by persons standing on the ground or roof of a building, or reaching
               from a door or window, it shall be insulated, guarded or grounded.

               (i)

               All supply and bare communication system conductors supported by the same crossarm
               and running in the same direction shall not be less than eleven (11) inches apart,
               and conductors adjacent to the pole shall not be less than thirty (30) inches apart,
               to enable linemen to pass up and down the pole freely and without danger of contact
               with such conductors.

               (j)

               Supply system conductors running in the same direction shall not be attached to both
               the upperside and underside of the same crossarm.

               (k)

               Conductors crossing from one side of the street to the other shall cross at right
               angles as nearly as physical conditions permit, and shall cross from arms or brackets
               secured to poles or supporting fixtures. When crossing from one building to another,
               they shall do so from the highest practicable point of the same. When crossing conductors
               of another owner, they shall pass either over or under, and not between such other
               conductors. They shall be drawn taut, and at least twenty (20) inches' separation
               from such other wires shall be maintained to avoid swinging contacts.

               (l)

               No conductor shall hang less than eighteen (18) feet from the street or sidewalk at
               the lowest point of sag. However, if a communication system service drop or an effectively
               insulated or grounded guy crosses a street, the clearance may be reduced to sixteen
               (16) feet at the side of the traveled way; and where communication system wires or
               cables cross over or run along alleys, the clearance may be reduced to fifteen (15)
               feet.

               (m)

               Where sharp angles occur in a line, or where it is necessary to run conductors so
               that the tendency is to lift the supports, appropriate means shall be employed to
               prevent such conductors from pulling away from their crossarms or other supports.

               (n)

               Conductors shall not be attached to chimneys and shall not be attached to or carried
               near fire escapes in such a way that they will interfere with the free use of the
               same, or be within reach of persons standing thereon.

               (o)

               Unused services and drop wires from supply system circuits which in the opinion of
               the inspector of wires constitute a nuisance or hazard to the public shall be removed
               by the owners thereof upon written notice from said inspector. Dead or unused wires
               not removed within a reasonable time after notice given by the inspector of wires
               may be removed by the inspector of wires at the expense of the owners.

               (p)

               Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all overhead conductors, unless properly
               guarded, shall be at least eight (8) feet above the highest portion of flat-roofed
               buildings, or the ridge of pitched-roof buildings. With respect to pitched-roof buildings,
               the clearance shall be at least three (3) feet for supply system service cables carrying
               voltages not in excess of three hundred (300) volts and at least eight (8) inches
               for communication system conductors.

               (q)

               Whenever in the opinion of the inspector of wires any supply system overhead conductors,
               poles or supporting fixtures are in any unsafe or dangerous condition, the inspector
               will cause the current to be shut off forthwith, after notice to the owner thereof;
               and such defective conductors will then be treated as being dead and unused, and will
               be removed by the inspector at the expense of the owner thereof.

               for the total expenses of the enterprise, and an estimate of the income to be derived

               appropriation, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used
               for capital expenditures of the enterprise, subject to appropriation. If, during a

               Definition. A ""dangerous dog"" or ""vicious dog"" as used in this section, shall mean:

               1.

               Any dog that has bitten or attacked any person or has attempted to bite or attack
               any person. A dog shall be deemed to be attempting to attack, if it is restrained
               by a leash, fence or other means, and it is clear from the dog's excited actions that
               only the presence of the leash, fence, or other means of restraint is preventing the
               dog from making an immediate attack.

               2.

               Any dog with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack, to cause injury
               to, or to otherwise threaten the safety of domestic animals.

               3.

               Any dog whether leashed or not which, in a vicious or terrorizing manner, approaches
               any person in an apparent attitude of attack upon the streets, sidewalks, or any public
               grounds or places.

               4.

               Any dog owned or harbored primarily or in the past for the purpose of dog fighting
               or any trained for dog fighting.

               5.

               The determination that a dog is dangerous or vicious under this section shall be in
               the discretion of the animal control officer and the animal control officer shall
               notify the owner of any such determination.

               Except that no dog shall be considered dangerous or vicious if:

               1.

               A human being who, at the time the injury was sustained, was committing criminal trespass
               or other tort upon premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or was teasing, tormenting,
               abusing or assaulting the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.

               2.

               A domestic animal, which, at the time the injury was sustained, was teasing, tormenting,
               abusing or assaulting the dog.

               3.

               A domestic animal while the dog was working as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator
               control dog on the property of or under the control of its owner, and the injury was
               to a species or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the dog.

               4.

               The dog was protecting or defending a person within the immediate vicinity of the
               dog from an attack or assault.

               5.

               The actions of the dog under the consideration occurred under official duties as a
               military, correctional, or police dog.

               6.

               In the discretion of the animal control officer, the dog acted in reaction to pain
               or injury; or was protecting itself, its kennel or its offspring.

               (b)

               Duties of animal control when dog is deemed dangerous. When a dog is deemed to be dangerous or vicious, the animal control officer shall
               order all of the following:

               1.

               Spay or neutering, if the animal is not already altered. The animal will be exempt
               from such an order if a veterinarian certifies in a written statement that the animal
               is unfit for alterations because of medical conditions.

               2.

               Microchip identification, if the animal is not already microchipped.

               3.

               Behavior training from a certified behaviorist, as determined by the office of animal
               control; and

               4.

               Rabies vaccination as required by M.G.L.A. c. 140, § 145B, if the animal is not up
               to date on its annual vaccinations, as certified by a licensed veterinarian.

               (c)

               Outdoor confinement. No person shall own, keep or harbor, or allow to be upon any premises occupied by
               him under his charge or control, any vicious dog; or any dog of a cross, dangerous
               or ferocious disposition, or a dog that may manifest a disposition to bite, without
               it being confined to a proper enclosure.

               For purposes of this subsection, a proper enclosure shall mean a securely enclosed
               pen or structure suitably padlocked to reasonably prevent the entry of any person
               to enter or release the dog that is not authorized by the dog's owner and designed
               to prevent escape by the dog. The proper enclosure shall also have secure sides and
               top and shall provide protection and shelter for the dog from the elements and weather.
               Said proper enclosure must be a chain link structure or pen of dimensions at least
               twelve (12) feet by twelve (12) feet and six (6) feet high containing a solid floor
               sufficient to prevent the dog's escape by digging or breaking floor. The proper enclosure
               must be inspected and approve by the animal control department before use of said
               proper enclosure satisfies the requirements of this subsection.

               Whenever the dog is removed from its proper enclosure, the dog shall be securely muzzled
               and leashed on a leash no longer than four (4) feet in length. The dog must be under
               control of a responsible person eighteen (18) years of age or older. No such dogs
               are allowed on or within five hundred (500) feet of any city parks, playgrounds whether
               at large or under restraint.

               (d)

               Indoor confinement. No vicious dog may be kept on a porch, patio, or in any part of a house or structure
               that would allow the dog to exit such building on its own volition. In addition, no
               such animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or when
               screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacles preventing the dog from exiting
               the structure.

               (e)

               Signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of vicious dogs shall display in a prominent place
               on their premises a sign easily readable by the public, using the words ""Beware of
               Dog."" In addition, a similar sign is required to be posted on the kennel or pen of
               such dog.

               (f)

               Insurance. The owner or custodian of any vicious dog shall maintain a policy of insurance in
               an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per incident insuring
               such person against any claim, loss damage, or injury to any human being resulting
               from the acts of such dog. Such person shall produce evidence of the required insurance
               upon the request of an animal control officer. This section shall not apply to dogs
               kept by law enforcement agencies.

               (g)

               Giving away, selling, bartering. Any dog deemed vicious under this section shall not be given away, sold or bartered
               unless new owners comply with the commands or directions under this section.

               (h)

               Impoundment. Any dog found running at large or in violation of this section shall be impounded
               by the animal control officer and cannot be claimed until the provisions of the section
               are met. The impoundment fee is borne by the owner whether or not such dog is claimed.
               If such dog is not reclaimed within ten (10) days of such impoundment, the animal
               may be disposed of by adoption or euthanasia, dependent upon species and condition
               of the animal impounded, which determination shall be made by the dog officer.

               (i)

               Destruction. When, in the judgment of the animal control officer, a dog should be destroyed after
               being determined to be vicious, M.G.L.A. c. 140, § 157, shall be applicable.

               (j)

               Licensing surcharge. The annual licensing fee for a dangerous dog shall include a fifty dollar ($50.00)
               surcharge in addition to the regular licensing fee. The surcharge required by this

               Definition. A ""potentially dangerous dog"" as used in this section, shall mean:

               1.

               Any dog that is impounded or its owners cited for allowing a dog to run off leash
               two (2) or more times in a twelve-month period; or

               2.

               Any dog that acts in a highly aggressive manner, when unprovoked. Within a fenced
               yard or enclosure and appears to the animal control officer to be able to jump over
               or escape. Vocalization or barking, without more, shall not cause a dog to be deemed
               of a highly aggressive manner.

               3.

               Any dog owned by a person cited more than once for allowing said dog to run at large
               in any public streets or places in the city or upon the premises of anyone other than
               the owner or keeper without said owner's or occupant's permission as under section 4-28.

               4.

               The determination that a dog is potentially dangerous under this section shall be
               in the discretion of the animal control officer and the animal control officer shall
               notify the owner of any such determination.

               (b)

               Duties of animal control when dog is deemed potentially dangerous. When a dog is deemed to be potentially dangerous, the animal control officer shall
               order all of the following:

               1.

               Spay or neutering, if the animal is not already altered. The animal will be exempt
               from such an order if a veterinarian certifies in a written statement that the animal
               is unfit for alterations because of medical reasons.

               2.

               Microchip identification, if the animal is not already microchipped.

               3.

               Behavior training from a certified behaviorist, as determined by the office of animal
               control; and

               4.

               Rabies vaccination as required by M.G.L.A. c. 140, § 145B, if the animal is not up
               to date on its annual vaccinations, as certified by a licensed veterinarian.

               5.

               The owner provides adequate security to the premises where the potentially dangerous
               dog is kept, as specifically described in writing to the owner by the animal control
               officer. Said owner must comply within sixty (60) days of receiving description.

               (c)

               Persons responsible. No person under the age of 18 shall own, handle, control or be responsible for a
               potentially dangerous dog.

               (d)

               Signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of potentially dangerous dogs shall display in
               a prominent place on their premises a sign easily readable by the public, using the
               words ""Beware of Dog."" In addition, a similar sign is required to be posted on the
               kennel or pen of such dog.

               (e)

               Licensing surcharge. The annual licensing fee for a potentially dangerous dog shall include a twenty-five
               dollar ($25.00) surcharge in addition to the regular licensing fee. The animal control
               officer shall enforce the surcharge required by this provision.

               (f)

               Penalties. After thirty (30) days of being notified that a dog is potentially dangerous, any
               owner found not in compliance with any of the provisions of this section, except for
               subsection (b)5. for which violations found after sixty (60) days of said notification,
               shall be subject to a one hundred dollar ($100.00) fine for any first offense; two
               hundred dollars ($200.00) for any second offense; and three hundred dollars ($300.00)
               for any offense thereafter. Each day that the owner is not in compliance shall constitute
               a separate offense.

               thereupon be securely quarantined at the direction of the dog officer for a period
               of ten (10) days, and shall not be released from such quarantine except by written
               permission of the dog officer. At the discretion of the dog officer, such quarantine

               or at the owner's option and expense, in a veterinary hospital of such owner's choice.
               In the case of stray animals, or in the case of animals the ownership of which is
               not known, such quarantine shall be at the shelter designated as the city pound.

               The owner upon demand by the dog officer shall forthwith surrender any animal which
               has bitten a human, or which is suspected as having been exposed to rabies, for supervised
               quarantine, the expense of which shall be borne by the owner. Said animal may be reclaimed
               by the owner if it is adjudged free of rabies, upon payment of fees set forth in section 4-34.

               (c)

               When rabies has been diagnosed in an animal under quarantine or rabies suspected by
               a licensed veterinarian, and the animal dies while under such observation, the dog
               officer shall immediately send the head of such animal to the Massachusetts Health
               Department for pathological examination and shall notify the proper public health
               officer of reports of human contacts and diagnosis.

               (d)

               When one or both reports indicate a positive diagnosis of rabies, the dog officer
               shall recommend an areawide quarantine for a period of sixty (60) days, and upon invoking
               of such emergency quarantine, no pet animal shall be taken into the streets, or permitted
               to be in the streets, during such quarantine, and no animal may be taken or shipped
               from the city without written permission of the dog officer. During this quarantine
               period and as long afterward as the health officer decides it is necessary to prevent
               the spread of rabies, the health officer shall require all dogs three (3) months of
               age and older to be vaccinated against rabies with a canine rabies vaccine approved
               by the Biologics Control Section of the United States Department of Agriculture. The
               types of approved canine antirabies vaccine to be used and the recognized duration
               of immunity for each shall be established by the health officer. All vaccinated dogs
               shall be restricted (leashing or confinement on enclosed premises) for thirty (30)
               days after vaccination. During the quarantine period, the health officer shall be
               empowered to provide for a program of mass immunization by the establishment of temporary
               emergency canine rabies vaccination clinics located throughout the city. No dog which
               has been impounded by reason of its being a stray, unclaimed by its owner, is allowed
               to be claimed during the period of the rabies emergency quarantine, except by special
               authorization of the health officer and the dog officer.

               (e)

               Dogs bitten by a known rabid animal shall be immediately destroyed or if the owner
               is unwilling to destroy the exposed animal, strict isolation of the animal in a kennel
               for six (6) months shall be enforced.

               In the event there are additional positive cases of rabies occurring during the period

                  to size.

                  (5)

                  No sign shall be erected in any manner that will cover any windows or doors or otherwise

                  A sign attached at right angles to a building shall project no more than six (6) feet
                  from the building. No more than one projecting sign is allowed for each entrance to

               The maximum allowable number of square feet of permanent signage for a business or
               use in the Central Business District (CBD) shall be determined by the distance of
               a building from the center line of the street or pedestrian mall it faces and by the
               business's street frontage.

               (b)

               The following shall be used to compute maximum square footage of signs allowed for
               an individual business or use:

                               If

                              Then

                              Average distance of the building face from center line of abutting street is:

                              Multiply the number of feet of the use's street frontage by:

                               0—99 feet

                               3

                               100—399 feet

                               4

                               400 and more

               &nbsp;

               Examples:

               (1)

               When computing to erect a parallel sign: A store has a street frontage of twenty (20)
               feet and is twenty-five (25) feet from the street center line. Multiply twenty (20)
               feet by three (3) and sixty (60) square feet will be the maximum allowed display surface.

               (2)

               When computing to erect both a projecting sign and a parallel sign: A store has a
               street frontage of twenty (20) feet and is twenty-five (25) feet from the street center
               line. Multiply twenty (20) feet by three (3) and sixty (60) square feet will be the
               maximum total display surface allowed. The square footage of the projecting sign (maximum
               size, twenty-four (24) square feet) is subtracted from the maximum display surface
               (sixty (60) square feet). The remaining square footage is the maximum allowed for
               a parallel sign.

               return receipt requested, if he is known and within the commonwealth.

               (4)

               If the order is directed against the owner and if the residence and whereabouts of
               the owner or his agent are unknown or without the commonwealth, the enforcing official
               may direct the order to be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place
               on the premises and by advertising it for at least three (3) out of five (5) consecutive
               days in one or more newspapers of general circulation within New Bedford.

               other action as is necessary to enforce the provisions of this article including as
               provided below in section 6-123. Additionally, any violation related to housing, sanitation or snow and ice can be

               or structure, that the building or structure is beyond repair, that conditions exist
               which constitute a violation of this article, and that efforts to secure the building
               or structure so as abate any condition constituting a violation have failed to abate
               the violation, such official may issue an order that the building or structure be
               demolished. The order shall be issued in accordance with the procedure set forth in
               section 6-122(c) of this article.

               b.

               the order:

               1.

               Institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for criminal prosecution
               of the owner for violation of this action seeking an order from the court for the

               (b)

               Notice. Notice of the intention to make such repairs or other corrective action shall
               be served on the owner in such a manner as required in section 6-122(c) of this article.

               Once designated a problem property, a property shall remain so designated until the
               police department confirms that the property has not been the subject of a valid complaint
               for a period of no less than twelve (12) months.

               (3)

               department personnel dispatched or caused to respond to an incident, that a misdemeanor
               or felony under Massachusetts law has taken place in a dwelling unit within a property,
               on a property, or on an immediate sidewalk or street or abutting property, involving
               tenants, occupants, residents, or persons allowed on the property. A complaint need
               not result in an arrest or a formal criminal charge to be deemed a valid complaint.
               A ""valid complaint,"" as used in this chapter, shall not include a police response
               based on a complaint by an occupant of the property who is a victim or a family member
               of a victim of the reported offense. This term shall not include incidents involving
               an occupant of the premises who is the victim of domestic violence and who reported
               the incident of domestic violence to the police.

               (4)

               The ""City"" shall mean the mayor or his or her authorized designee.

               (5)

               The term ""police response"" shall mean any and all police action deemed appropriate
               by the police chief to protect the health, safety and welfare of inhabitants of a
               property, location, or immediate area where valid complaints have been documented,
               including the posting of police personnel at or near the property.

               (b)

               notice, in writing, to the property owner and by regular and certified mail, return

               The police chief shall keep an accurate record of the actual cost of police response
               to a dwelling unit within a property, a particular property or a specific location,
               and such record shall include the number of officers who are part of the determined
               response, the amount of time each officer worked on the response, and the actual cost
               of each officer's participation in the response based on that officer's actual rate
               of pay;

               (2)

               The police chief shall forward such record to the collector-treasurer;

               After a dwelling unit within a property, or the entire property has been determined

               2.

               Identifying the number of valid complaints that have occurred since the property's
               designation as a problem property;

               3.

               Informing the property owner of the costs assessed under this ordinance;

               4.

               Indicating where and to whom the property owner must address a letter of appeal of
               police response costs assigned to him or her;

               5.

               Informing the property owner that he or she has fourteen (14) business days to file

               The police department shall have the authority to consider the nature of the incident(s)

               b.

               The police department shall consider the following factors in making their decision
               to assess costs:

               1.

               The nature of the incident(s) underlying the valid complaints;

               2.

               Whether the incident(s) resulted in an arrest;

               3.

               The effect of the activity on the quality of life in the neighborhood;

               4.

               The property owner's and occupant's willingness to cooperate with police;

               5.

               The history of criminal activity taking place at the property or location.

               (e)

               Payments.

               (1)

               The property owner is responsible for payment of the bill in full within thirty (30)
               business days of receiving the notification. All amounts collected by the collector-treasurer
               shall be deposited into a revolving fund under the control of the police department.
               If not paid, the collector-treasurer is hereby authorized and empowered to bill the
               property owner for the cost the city incurred for its police response.

               (2)

               Any unpaid bill for police response, including interest and/or collection costs, shall
               be added to the real estate tax on the property and collected as part of that tax.
               Failure to pay real estate taxes will render the property owner delinquent and the
               collector-treasurer shall commence foreclosure proceedings;

               (3)

               All charges to recover costs imposed in this ordinance shall constitute a municipal
               charges lien on the property so charged in accordance with M.G.L.A. c. 40, § 58.

               (f)

               Appeal of designation or cost assessment.

               (1)

               The property owner may, within fourteen (14) business days of receipt of the problem
               property designation or cost assessment, appeal the decision by requesting, in writing,
               a hearing before the problem properties appeals panel. The problem properties appeals
               panel shall be a three-person panel consisting of one (1) member appointed by the
               mayor, one member appointed by the city council, and one (1) member appointed by the
               mayor and confirmed by the city council. The term for members for the problem properties
               appeals panel shall be three (3) years.

               (2)

               The problem properties appeals panel shall determine whether, in light of the factors
               specified in section (c)(3)b. above, the police department's decision to assess the
               costs of a police response at a problem property was reasonable. The problem properties
               appeals panel may uphold or reduce the costs assessed by the police department, but
               it may not increase them. The problem properties appeals panel's decision must be
               in writing. If the problem properties appeals panel finds in favor of the property
               owner, the cost of the penalty shall be abated; if the assessment is upheld or reduced,
               it shall be due and payable within thirty (30) business days.

               (g)

               Eviction. In the event the property owner has, in good faith, commenced eviction proceedings
               against the tenant(s) responsible for the incident at the property that results in
               the assessment of costs, the assessment of costs shall be reduced to zero dollars
               ($0.00) for that particular incident. The police chief may continue police response
               at the particular property or location, at his or her discretion, at all times after
               the eviction proceeding has been completed; provided however that such costs shall
               not be assessed to the property owner.

               (h)

               Prevention. A landlord may request in writing that the city provide the landlord with a list
               of any valid complaints involving a prospective tenant occurring within one (1) year
               prior to the date of the written request. To the extent permitted by law, the city
               shall provide the information to the landlord within fourteen (14) business days of
               the written request.

               Failure of the city to provide such information that is found to have existed at the
               time of the written request and legally could have been provided to the landlord shall
               cause this ordinance to be invalid against the landlord for any valid complaints involving
               the prospective tenant for whom the written request was made.

               and decrease the value of surrounding properties, provide a location for criminal
               activity, and create significant costs to the city by virtue of the need for constant
               monitoring and occasional cleanup. Accordingly, the purpose of this article requiring
               the registration of all vacant buildings, both residential and commercial, is to assist
               the city government in protecting the public health, safety and welfare of its residents
               by encouraging the prompt repair, rehabilitation, and subsequent occupancy of vacant
               properties.

               of the notice of determination. Any person making such service shall execute an affidavit
               attesting to the facts of service. The commissioner shall maintain an affidavit of

               International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is a building energy code created
               by the International Code Council. It is a model code adopted by many state and municipal
               governments in the United States for the establishment of minimum design and construction
               requirements for energy efficiency, and is updated on a three-year cycle. The baseline
               energy conservation requirements of the Massachusetts Building Code are the IECC with
               Massachusetts amendments, as approved by the board of building regulations and standards.

               (b)

               Stretch Energy Code. The Stretch Energy Code is a Massachusetts Building Code based on further amendments
               to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) to improve the energy efficiency
               of buildings built to this Code. The Stretch Energy Code was codified by the board
               of building regulations and standards as an appendix, 780 CMR Appendix 115.AA, to

                  issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals, provided that the Board of Appeals
                  finds that the proposed use does not substantially derogate from the public good.

                  2322. Boarders in Single-Family Dwelling. The renting of rooms and/or furnishing of
                  board to not more than two (2) persons in an owner occupied single-family dwelling

                  the provisions of Section 2230, herein.

                  2323. Family Day Care Homes. In all districts, family day care may be provided as

                  which meet the fire rating standards of the Massachusetts Building Code for attached
                  garages, in which case the separation requirement is waived. Side yard requirements
                  for detached accessory garages shall be the same as for the principal dwelling. The
                  minimum distance from the rear lot line for detached garages shall be four (4) feet.

                  or structures shall be located within twelve (12) feet of any side lot line intersecting
                  such street. If located in excess of fifty (50) feet from the front street line, the
                  side yard setback shall conform to the requirements of the principal dwelling.

                  of the lot and not less than twelve (12) feet from the lot line intersecting said
                  street line. Such restriction may be waived by mutual agreement between the adjoining
                  property owners, secured by and filed with the Inspector of Buildings.

                  2336. No trailer shall be occupied for dwelling or sleeping purposes within any residential
                  district, except as allowed pursuant to M.G.L.A. 40A, § 3. A trailer may be permitted
                  to locate within any district other than a residential district provided a special
                  permit is granted by the City Council after a public hearing, upon a finding that
                  the placement and occupancy of the trailer will not be detrimental to the neighborhood
                  in which the lot is located and after consideration of the factors specified in Section
                  5300 herein.

                  2337. The initial term and subsequent terms of a special permit for a trailer shall
                  expire after two (2) years. In the event such special permit is renewed, after a public

                  detrimental to the neighborhood in which the lot is located and after consideration
                  of the factors specified in Section 5300 herein, the City Council shall promptly notify
                  the Inspector of Buildings. Subsequent special permit issuances for existing trailers,
                  if any, shall be granted after certification by affidavit is made by the applicant
                  that the trailer has not been extended, enlarged, or altered to increase its original
                  dimensions, or use as defined in the initial special permit application, and that
                  the need for the special permit still exists and there has been no change in the use
                  or circumstances for which the special permit was originally granted.

                  an obvious hazard, having a depth at any point of more than two (2) feet, shall cause
                  the same to be completely enclosed by a fence. All fence openings or points of entry
                  into the land area shall be equipped with gates. The fence and gates shall be four
                  (4) feet in height above the ground level. All gates shall be equipped with self-closing
                  and self-latching devices placed at the top of the gate. Swimming pools or fish ponds,
                  containing more than twenty-four (24) inches of water in depth, whether public or
                  private, shall be located in such a way that it will not be closer than three (3)
                  feet to any building, six (6) feet to any property line and shall not extend into

                  of the building on the lot, proposed accessory dwelling unit, location of any septic
                  system and required parking. A mortgage inspection survey, properly adapted by a surveyor,

                  2343. Certification by affidavit shall be provided that while said accessory dwelling
                  unit is occupied, the primary dwelling until shall be occupied by the owner of the

                  structure, in accordance with the following:

                  2345.a. Any accessory dwelling unit construction shall not create more than a fifteen
                  (15) percent increase in the gross floor space of the structure existing as of date
                  of enactment, December 23, 2003.

                  unit shall be enclosed, screened, or located so that visibility from public ways is
                  minimized.

                  2345.c. Sufficient and appropriate space for at least one additional parking space
                  shall be constructed by the owner to serve the accessory dwelling unit. Said parking
                  space shall be constructed of materials consistent with the existing driveway and
                  shall have vehicular access to the driveway.

                  2346. The initial term and subsequent terms of a special permit for an accessory dwelling
                  unit shall expire after two (2) years. In the event such special permit is not renewed,
                  the Board of Appeals shall promptly notify the Inspector of Buildings. Subsequent
                  special permit issuances for existing accessory dwelling unit, if any, shall be granted
                  after certification by affidavit is made by the applicant that the accessory dwelling
                  unit has not been extended, enlarged, or altered to increase its original dimensions,
                  as defined in the initial special permit application, and that the need for the special
                  permit still exists and there has been no change in the use or circumstances for which
                  the special permit was originally granted.

                  2347. Special permits for an accessory dwelling unit may be issued, after a public
                  hearing, upon a finding that the construction and occupancy of the apartment will
                  not be detrimental to the neighborhood in which the lot is located and after consideration
                  of the factors specified in Section 5300 herein.

               or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication
               of notice of the public hearing required by M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 5, at which this Zoning
               Ordinance, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing
               nonconforming uses and structures may continue, provided that no modification of the
               use or structure is accomplished, unless authorized hereunder.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2420. Nonconforming Uses. The Board of Appeals may award a special permit to change a nonconforming use in
               accordance with this Section only if it determines that such change or extension shall
               not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood.
               The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the Board
               of Appeals:

                  2421. Change or substantial extension of the use;

                  2422. Change from one nonconforming use to another, less detrimental, nonconforming
                  use.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2430. Nonconforming Structures, Other Than Single- and Two-Family Structures. The Board of Appeals may award a special permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or
               change a nonconforming structure in accordance with this Section only if it determines
               that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially
               more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. The
               following types of changes to nonconforming structures may be considered by the Board
               of Appeals:

                  2431. Reconstructed, extended or structurally changed;

                  2432. Altered to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose
                  in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent;

               The reconstruction, extension or structural change of such nonconforming structures
               so as to increase an existing nonconformity, or create a new nonconformity, including
               the extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within
               a required yard, shall require the issuance of a variance from the Board of Appeals.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2440. Nonconforming Single- and Two-Family Structures. Nonconforming single- and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed,
               extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the Inspector of
               Buildings that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does
               not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure, and the issuance of a building
               permit, where applicable. In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines
               that the nonconforming nature of such structure would be increased by the proposed
               reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the Board of Appeals may, by finding
               (which shall not require a super majority), allow such reconstruction, extension,
               alteration, or change where it determines that the proposed modification will not
               be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the
               neighborhood.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2450. Abandonment or Non-Use. A nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used for a period
               of two (2) years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions
               of this Zoning Ordinance.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2460. Catastrophe. Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed after a fire, explosion or other
               catastrophe, provided that such reconstruction is completed within twelve months after
               such catastrophe, and provided that the building(s) as reconstructed shall be only
               as great in volume or area as the original nonconforming structure unless a larger
               volume or area is authorized by special permit from the Board of Appeals. Such time
               for reconstruction may be extended by the Board of Appeals for good cause.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2470. Reversion to Nonconformity. No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use, revert to a nonconforming
               use.

                  the home occupation.

                  2514. The home occupation shall not serve clients, customers, pupils, salespersons,

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2520. Home Occupations by Special Permit. Businesses or professions incidental to and customarily associated with the principal
               residential use of premises may be engaged in as an accessory use by the owner of
               that dwelling upon the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals; provided,
               however, that all of the following conditions shall be satisfied:

                  2521. The occupation or profession shall be carried on wholly within the principal
                  building, or within a building or other structure accessory thereto, which has been

                  2522. Not more than thirty (30) percent of the combined floor area of the residence
                  and any qualified accessory structures shall be used in the home occupation.

                  2523. Only one home occupation may be conducted on the premises.

                  2524. The home occupation may serve clients, customers, pupils, salespersons, or the

               except in conformity with the requirements of this Section, unless exempted by this
               Ordinance or by statute.

                  2711. Lot change. No existing conforming or nonconforming lot shall be changed in
                  size or shape except through a public land taking or donation for road widening, drainage,
                  utility improvements or except where otherwise permitted herein, so as to violate
                  the provisions of this Ordinance with respect to the size of lots or yards or to create
                  a nonconformity or increase the degree of nonconformity that presently exists.

                  2712. Merger of lots. Adjacent lots held in common ownership on or after the effective
                  date of this Section shall be treated as a single lot for zoning purposes so as to
                  minimize nonconformities with the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance. Notwithstanding
                  the previous sentence, adjacent lots in common ownership may be treated as separate
                  lots for zoning purposes upon a finding by the zoning enforcement officer that the
                  owner of said lots has expressly exhibited the intent to maintain the lots as separate.
                  In making said finding the zoning enforcement officer shall rely on the following
                  factors:

                  2712.a. The existence and maintenance of walls or fences along the original lot lines;

                  2712.b. The fact that the lots are separately assessed for tax purposes;

                  2712.c. The placement of structures on the various lots.

                  The manner in which said lots were acquired or the fact that said lots were separately
                  described on a deed shall not be considered by the zoning enforcement officer in making
                  said finding.

                  2713. Recorded Lots. A lot or parcel of land having an area or frontage of lesser
                  amounts than required in the following schedule of dimensional requirements may be
                  considered as satisfying the area and frontage requirements of this Section provided
                  such lot or parcel of land was shown on a plan or described in a duly recorded deed
                  or registered at the time of adoption of this Ordinance and did not at the time of
                  adoptions of adjoin other land of the same owner available for use in connection with
                  such lot or parcel.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2720. Table of Dimensional Requirements. See Appendix B.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2730. Dimensional Variation. The Board of Appeals may vary otherwise applicable dimensional requirements pertaining
               to frontage, lot area, building height and sidelines upon finding that owing to circumstances
               relating to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures and
               especially affecting such land or structures but not affecting generally the zoning
               district in which it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance
               or by-law would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner
               or appellant, and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment
               to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent
               or purpose of such ordinance or by-law.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2740. Vision Clearance on Corner Lots in Residence Districts. On a corner lot no fence, wall or structure more than three and one-half (3½) feet
               high above the plane of the established grades of the streets shall be erected on
               a front or side yard herein established which is included within the street lines
               of the intersecting streets and a straight line connecting said street lines at points
               which are twenty (20) feet distant from their point of intersection, measured along
               said street line, and no trees or hedges which will materially obstruct the view of
               a driver of a vehicle approaching the street intersection shall be placed or maintained
               within such area.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2750. Yards in Residence Districts.

                  2751. Front Yards. No story or part of any building except projecting eaves or uncovered
                  steps shall be erected nearer to the street line of any street on which it fronts
                  than the average alignment of the corresponding stories or parts of existing buildings
                  within two hundred (200) feet on each side of the lot and within the same block and
                  district. Where there is a building on one or both of the adjoining lots, the front
                  yard for a building shall have a depth equal to the average of the front yard depths
                  of the two (2) adjoining lots. A lot without a building shall be counted as having
                  a front yard of the depth required by this Ordinance. If there are no existing buildings
                  on the same side of the street, the average setback alignment of corresponding stories
                  within two hundred (200) feet on each side of and directly opposite the lot shall
                  govern. Nothing in this Ordinance shall require any story or part of a building to
                  set back more than fifteen (15) feet from any street line. One street frontage of
                  a corner lot shall be exempt from these provisions as provided in subsection 2752.
                  The front yard of a lot shall remain clear of debris and junk.

                  2752. Where the alignment of a building is not controlled by subsection 2751, between
                  every building and the line of the street upon which it fronts there shall be a front
                  yard of a clear depth of fifteen (15) feet, except that on one side of a corner lot
                  a yard of a clear depth of not less than ten (10) feet shall be provided, in which
                  case this distance shall not be considered in determining the front yard depths on
                  such street.

                  2753. Rear Yards. There shall be a rear yard on every lot and it shall be at least
                  thirty (30) feet deep behind a dwelling, except that a ground story deck or porch,
                  without a permanent roof, a patio, or a pool (including any projections therefrom)
                  may extend to six (6) feet of a rear lot line. An unattached private garage may extend
                  to four feet of a rear yard. A storage shed may extend to eighteen (18) inches of
                  a rear yard unless a fence is erected on the property along the rear yard line. In
                  such case the storage shed may extend to eighteen (18) inches of the fence or fence
                  post whichever is closest. Unless referenced in this Code, nothing may be placed or
                  constructed in or upon the ground within six (6) feet of a rear lot line. Notwithstanding
                  the previous sentence, a fence may be constructed near or along a rear lot line and
                  vegetation may also be planted within six (6) feet of a rear lot line.

                  2754. Where a lot is more than one hundred (100) feet deep, one-half (½) of the additional
                  depth of the lot in excess of one hundred (100) feet shall be added to said rear yard
                  depth; but in no case shall a rear yard depth in excess of forty (40) feet be required.
                  The setbacks referenced in the previous section shall also apply to this Section.

                  2755. Side Yards. There shall be a side yard on every lot and it shall be at least
                  ten (10) feet on one side and twelve (12) feet on the other side. The side yard shall
                  be unobstructed from the line of the street to the rear lot line except that open
                  porches, decks, steps, patios and pools (including any projections therefrom), which
                  are located behind the dwelling within the rear yard, may extend to six (6) feet of
                  a side lot line, driveways may extend to four (4) feet of a side lot line and storage
                  sheds, which are located behind the dwelling within the rear yard may extend to eighteen
                  (18) inches of a side yard unless a fence is erected on the property along the side
                  yard line. In such case the storage shed may extend eighteen (18) inches of the fence
                  or fence post whichever is closest. For all driveways, including those regulated under
                  Section 2756, the area between a driveway and the side lot line shall be of a different
                  material than the material used for the driveway and shall not be covered with an
                  impervious surface or crushed stone.

                  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, any driveway existing prior to April
                  15, 2009, that is made of a material that creates an impervious surface, may be permitted
                  for repair, resurfacing or reconstruction with substantially the same type of material
                  provided that the dimensions of the driveway are not increased and the location of
                  the driveway layout is not altered.

                  2756. Special Driveway Side Yard Requirements. For existing dwellings on lot sizes
                  of less than five thousand (5,000) square feet, driveways shall not extend to the
                  side lot line closer than ten (10) percent of the distance between the side lot line
                  and the principle dwelling. For any driveway in excess of thirteen (13) feet in width,
                  the provisions of Section 2755 regulating driveway setbacks shall apply and this section
                  shall not apply.

               2770. Courts.

                  2771. If any part of a story of a nonresidence building is used for offices, studios
                  or workshops which are not lighted from the street or the rear yard, there shall be
                  a court starting not more than fifty (50) feet from the main exterior walls of that
                  story.

                  2772. If any part of a story is used for living or sleeping rooms which are not lighted

                  2774. The minimum width of an outer court shall be double that required in this Section
                  for an inner court.

                  2775. A cornice or belt course shall not project more than six (6) inches into any
                  inner court.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               2780. Height of Buildings. The provisions governing the height of buildings in Appendix B shall apply to chimneys,
               cooling towers, flagpoles, elevator bulkheads, skylights, ventilators, and other necessary

               of use of land shall be provided with off-street parking spaces and off-street loading
               spaces in accordance with Section 3130, Table of Parking Requirements.

                  3111. In the event of the enlargement of a structure existing on the effective date
                  of the ordinance from which this Section is derived, or the construction or relocation
                  of additional structures on a lot, after such effective date, the regulations of this
                  Section shall apply only to the enlargement, construction or relocation thereof, except
                  that any off-street parking and off-street loading facilities established to serve
                  any buildings and any uses prior to such effective date shall not be reduced below
                  the required number.

                  3112. For a building or premises used for combined purposes, the number of off-street
                  parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be determined as the sum of the
                  required number of spaces in each component of the combined use.

                  3113. Where the computation of required parking spaces and loading spaces result in
                  a fractional number, the required parking spaces shall be the next whole number.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               3120. Special Permit. Any parking or loading requirement set forth herein may be reduced upon the issuance
               of a special permit by the Planning Board if the Board finds that the reduction is
               not inconsistent with public health and safety, or that the reduction promotes a public
               benefit. Such cases might include:

                  3121. Use of a common parking lot for separate uses having peak demands occurring
                  at different times;

                  3122. Age or other characteristics of occupants of the facility requiring parking
                  which reduces auto usage;

                  3123. Peculiarities of the use which make usual measures of demand invalid;

                  3124. Availability of on-street parking or parking at nearby municipally owned facilities.

                  3125. Where a special permit is granted, a reserve area, to be maintained indefinitely
                  as landscaped open space, may be required sufficient to accommodate the difference
                  between the spaces otherwise required and the spaces reduced by special permit. The
                  parking/site plan shall show (in dotted outline) how the reserve area would be laid
                  out in to provide the otherwise required number of spaces.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               3130. Table of Parking and Loading Requirements. See Appendix C.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               3140. Location and Layout of Parking and Loading Facilities. Off-street parking and loading, for facilities other than single- or two-family residences,
               may be provided in structures or in the open air, and shall be subject to the following
               regulations pertaining to their layout and location:

                  3141. Parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use where
                  they are intended to serve, except that they may be provided on an adjoining lot in
                  the same ownership.

                  3142. Where the provisions of subsection 3141 cannot be satisfied and the parking
                  lot contains five (5) or more required spaces, the required parking spaces may be
                  located on a lot in the same ownership within two hundred (200) feet of the building
                  or lot they are intended to serve.

                  3143. Parking space for three (3) or fewer vehicles may be provided in the form of
                  a driveway on a lot; the improved surface may be extended to one foot of the side
                  line.

                  3144. Where a drive or aisle, other than a street, is required to maneuver a vehicle
                  into or out of a parking space, such drive or aisle shall be at least twenty-two (22)
                  feet wide for parking spaces situated at right angles, or nearly right angles to the
                  aisle. For parking spaces situated at an angle of thirty (30) to sixty (60) degrees
                  to the aisle, the required width of the aisle shall be at least fifteen (15) feet.

                  3145. Open-air off-street parking facilities may be located in required front, rear
                  and side yards, except that in a residential district, no open-air off-street parking
                  space shall be located in front of the dwelling or principal building. Notwithstanding
                  the previous sentence, in cases where a garage faces the frontage of the dwelling
                  and is located beneath the dwelling, open-air off-street parking may be located in
                  front of the dwelling in a residential district provided that the dwelling is set
                  back a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the front property line and provided that
                  said parking occurs only within the driveway, the width of which shall not exceed
                  the lesser of the width of said garage or eighteen (18) feet. Any driveway in a residential
                  district, requiring more than one curb cut, shall require Site Plan Approval. No driveway
                  in a residential district shall exceed eighteen (18) feet in width.

                  3146. When five (5) or more parking spaces are required on a lot, the provisions of
                  Section 3300 shall apply. All spaces shall be laid out so that vehicles can enter
                  or leave any parking space directly from a drive or aisle other than a street. Additionally,
                  all spaces shall be laid out so the vehicles entering a street may do so facing the
                  street.

                  3147. All parking spaces and loading areas or berths in the open-air and the access
                  drives or aisles, shall be provided with a concrete or asphalt surface. Compacted
                  gravel or stone shall be permitted only for single- or two-family residential dwellings.

                  For any development under Site Plan review, the Planning Board may determine that
                  an alternate surface proposed on plans submitted for site plan review is suitable
                  based on the scope, use, character and nature of the property served by the subject
                  parking or loading area and that the proposed surface is appropriate based upon its'
                  relationship to the character and nature of the area and neighborhood in which the
                  particular property is located. The Planning Board may allow a suitable alternative
                  surface for parking areas provided such areas are graded and surfaced with a suitably
                  stable material to prevent excessive dust, erosion, odor, unsightly conditions or
                  inflow into the City's wastewater system or wetlands, and provided the perimeter of
                  such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties or other similar
                  material. Curbing shall be placed at the edges of surfaced areas, except driveways,
                  in order to protect landscaped areas and to prevent the parking of vehicles within
                  required setback areas. Entrance and exit driveways shall be clearly defined by curb
                  cuts, signs, striping.

                  If an alternative surface is used, a written agreement and maintenance plan of City
                  right-of-way adjacent to property shall be provided to the planning board for approval.
                  Storm Water Management systems within private property need to be constructed and
                  maintained in accordance with the City's Stormwater Management Rules and Regulations.

               (Ord. of 4-7-20, § 1)

               3148. No off-street loading areas or berths shall be laid out in such a manner as
               will result in loading or unloading being carried on within a street right-of-way
               or other public property. Each area or berth shall be sufficient size as to accommodate
               the largest expected truck or tractor trailer common to the building use.

               3149. Special Permit for Commercial Parking in Residential Districts. Commercial parking
               may be allowed on residentially zoned property, held in common ownership and located
               immediately adjacent to the commercial business to which it is to serve, upon the
               issuance of a special permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals, if the Board finds that
               said parking is not detrimental to public health and safety, and that said parking
               promotes a public benefit. A Special Permit for vehicular access to a building lot
               accessed from public way that does not constitute frontage of the lot. Upon the issuance
               of a special permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals, vehicular access may be allowed
               from a public way that does not constitute the legal frontage of the subject lot if
               said lot is residentially zoned, if the proposed vehicular access is for the purpose
               of accessing parking that is located beside or behind the dwelling or principal building,
               and if the Board finds that said vehicular access promotes a public benefit and is
               not detrimental to public health and safety. Notwithstanding Section 5240 of Chapter 9 of the Code of Ordinances or any other provision to the contrary, no fee of any kind
               shall be charged or imposed by the Special Permit Authority to the applicant of a
               Special Permit applied for under this Section.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1; Ord. of 8-22-06, § 1)

               3150. Size of Parking Space. A parking space shall be a rectangle at least nine (9) feet by twenty (20) feet exclusive
               of any required drive or aisle.

                  3151. The area of required off-street loading space is not to be included as off-street
                  parking space in the computation of required off-street parking space.

               (A)

               Signs constitute a separate and distinct use of the land upon which they are placed
               and affect the use of adjacent streets sidewalks and other public places and adjacent
               private places open to the public. The unregulated construction, placement and display
               of signs constitute a public nuisance detrimental to the health, safety, convenience
               and welfare of the residents of the City.

               (B)

               The purpose of article 3200 is to establish reasonable and impartial regulations for
               all exterior signs and those interior signs designed to attract the attention of persons
               located outdoors in order to: reduce traffic hazards caused by such unregulated signs
               which may distract and confuse, and impair the visibility of, motorists and pedestrians;
               ensure the effectiveness of public traffic signs and signals; protect property values
               by ensuring the compatibility of property with that surrounding it; provide an attractive
               visual environment throughout the City; protect the character and appearance of the
               various neighborhoods in the City; attract tourists to the City; protect the public
               investment in streets, highways, and other public improvements; and protect and improve
               the public health, safety, and general welfare. Additionally it is intended to protect
               the Central Business District and Historic District in accordance with the purposes
               stated in Section 3200AA.

               (C)

               The regulations contained in this Section advance these significant government interests
               and are the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve them.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               3210. General Regulations.

                  This sign ordinance shall apply to all City signs and their supporting devices, including
                  signs located within the Chapter 40C Historic District. Signs in the Historic District
                  will require approval from the New Bedford Historical Commission.

                  This ordinance shall not apply to signs erected by government agencies.

                  Any sign or any related frame, structure or mounting device, deemed to be abandoned
                  by the Inspector of Buildings must be removed from the premises by the owner of the
                  premises upon cessation of the business, activity, trade, product or service.

                  Any sign, display or device allowed in this Section may contain, in lieu of any other
                  copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct attention to
                  a business operated for profit, or to a commodity or service for sale, and that complies
                  with all other requirements of this Chapter.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

                  on the date of enactment of this Ordinance may be maintained, repaired or replaced
                  provided in the latter case that the sign area is neither increased nor larger than

               use in the Central Business District (CBD) shall be determined by the distance of
               a building from the center line of the street it faces and by the business's street
               frontage. The following shall be used to compute maximum square footage of signs allowed
               for an individual business or use:

                                 If

                                 Then

                                 The average distance of the building face from the center line of the abutting Street
                                 is:

                                 Multiply the number of feet of the use's
                                 
                                 street frontage by:

                  3277AA. Establishments in which the sole place of business is above the street level
                  may locate a sign higher than twenty-five (25) feet above grade. However, all other

               replaces an existing sign must comply with these regulations.

                  3281AA. An existing sign that does not now conform may be repaired provided the cost
                  of repair does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost for the entire
                  sign. Such cost estimates shall be verified by the Inspector of Buildings.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               Inspector of Buildings. The Inspector of Buildings may order the removal of any sign
               in any location in the Central Business District (CBD) where the maintenance thereof
               constitutes a fire hazard, is dangerous or a menace to public health or safety, when
               the use thereof has been abandoned, or the permit for its use has been revoked.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               3320. Applicability. The requirements of this Section shall apply to:

                  of a masonry wall, wooden fence or a vinyl fence produced to resemble a classical
                  wooden fence, the remainder of the required five-foot strip shall be landscaped with
                  trees and shrubs. Lawn or bark mulch may be used as ground cover in conjunction with
                  such trees and shrubs. The schedule and amount of plantings will be determined subject
                  to the schedule found in Appendix B and shall be reviewed during the site plan review

                  materials to be screened be in excess of ten (10) feet in height.

                  3334. Except for on-premises directional signs not in excess of six (6) square feet

               3340. Special Permit. Any screening or landscaping requirement set forth herein may be reduced upon the
               issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board if the Board finds that the reduction
               is not inconsistent with public health and safety, or that the reduction promotes
               a public benefit.

               3350. Coordination with Site Plan Approval. The Planning Board shall not approve a site plan unless said plan complies in all
               pertinent respects with the requirements of section 3300.

                     the proposed project protects the City's heritage by minimizing removal or disruption
                     of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures or architectural elements,
                     whether these exist on the site or on adjacent properties. If the building is a municipally
                     owned building, the proposed uses and structures are consistent with any conditions
                     imposed by the Planning Board on the sale, lease, or transfer of the site.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               4750. Standards. In order to be eligible for consideration for a special permit pursuant to this Section,
               the proposed development shall meet all of the following standards:

                  4751. Minimum dimensional requirements for ALFs and ILFs shall be as set forth in
                  the district in which the proposed facility is located.

                  4752. Buffer. A buffer area of twenty (20) feet shall be provided at the perimeter
                  of the property where it abuts residentially zoned or occupied properties, except
                  for driveways necessary for access and egress to and from the site. No vegetation
                  in this buffer area will be disturbed, destroyed or removed, except for normal maintenance.
                  The Planning Board may waive the buffer requirement (i) where the land abutting the
                  site is the subject of a permanent restriction for conservation or recreation so long
                  as a buffer is established of at least ten (10) feet in depth which may include such
                  restricted land area within such buffer area calculation; or (ii) where the land abutting
                  the site is held by the City for conservation or recreation purposes; or (iii) the
                  Planning Board determines that a smaller buffer will suffice to accomplish the objectives
                  set forth herein.

                  4753. Removal and Replacement of Vegetation. With the site, no clear cutting shall
                  be permitted, except incidental to construction of buildings, roads, trails and parking
                  areas.

                  4754. Roadways. The principal roadway(s) serving the site shall be designed to conform
                  with the standards of the City where the roadway is or may be ultimately intended
                  for dedication and acceptance by the City of New Bedford. Private ways shall be adequate
                  for the intended use and vehicular traffic and shall be maintained by an association
                  of unit owners or by the Applicant.

                  4755. Parking. The applicant shall provide adequate parking to serve all anticipated
                  uses on the property, with information detailing the method of computation of parking
                  spaces. The minimum number of parking spaces provided on the site shall be 0.5 parking
                  space per dwelling unit in an ALF and 1.0 parking space per dwelling unit in an ILF.
                  For both ALFs and ILFs one parking space shall be provided for every three (3) employees
                  during the largest shift. The Planning Board may increase the required parking by
                  up to ten (10) percent to serve the needs of employees, visitors and service vehicles.
                  All parking areas shall be screened from view from adjacent residentially zoned or
                  occupied premises located outside the site, including public ways, by a landscaped
                  border at least ten (10) feet in width. Parking lots in front setbacks in residential
                  zones, and in buffer areas in all zones, with the exception of necessary access driveways,
                  are prohibited. Parking areas in residential districts shall be located to the side
                  or rear of all buildings. Parking lot layout shall be planned to permit landscaping,
                  buffering, or screening to prevent direct views of parked vehicles from adjacent streets.
                  The use of traditional picket fencing, hedges, walls, or landscape berms to define
                  parking areas is encouraged. In parking areas of eleven or more parking stalls, at
                  least one tree of three inch or greater caliper shall be planted for every six (6)
                  parking places. Adequate tree wells and irrigation shall be provided for all parking
                  lot landscaping. Pedestrian access is to be taken into consideration in parking lot
                  design. The use of separate walkways is encouraged. Textured paving or grade separated
                  (elevated) walkways are desired on all pedestrian access ways.

                  4756. Loading. Loading areas must be at least 20 × 9 feet, and have a minimum overhead
                  clearance of ten (10) feet. Screening and landscaping shall be provided to block all
                  views of loading areas (except those specifically designated for emergency vehicles)
                  from the public right-of-way and adjacent properties.

                  4757. Surface Drainage. The surface drainage system shall be designed in accordance
                  with the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the Planning Board, if any, and the
                  standards of the Department of Public Works.

                  4758. Utilities. All electric, gas, telephone, and water distribution lines shall
                  be placed underground, except upon a demonstration of exceptional circumstances.

                  4759. Paths. Paths for the use of residents shall be attractively designed with proper
                  regard for convenience, separation of vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic, adequate
                  connectivity, completeness of access to the various amenities and facilities on the
                  site and to pathways on adjacent sites.

                  4751A. Paving and Curbing. Where the roadway is or may be ultimately intended for
                  dedication and acceptance by the City of New Bedford, granite curbing, gray in color,
                  is required, except in areas of very low traffic volume where no curbing will be required.
                  Rolled asphalt (Cape Cod berm) curbing is unacceptable in all such ways. Curbing is
                  to be sloped or cut to provide a barrier free transition at road crossings and building
                  entrances. Paving should be textured or of different materials at pedestrian crossings
                  and walkways. The use of stone, brick or cultured stone pavers for entrance walkway
                  borders is encouraged. The use of textured materials for walkway borders is encouraged.

                  4751B. Design and Architectural Character. The Planning Board may require massing
                  and style, roofs, facade elements, entrances, door and window openings, building materials
                  and design elements consistent with the City and the neighborhood.

                  4751C. The ALF or ILF shall have an integrated emergency call, telephone and other
                  communications system to provide monitoring for its residents. There shall be sufficient
                  site access for public safety vehicles. A plan shall be approved by the Fire Department
                  and the Inspector of Buildings for the emergency evacuation of the residents with
                  emphasis on ensuring the safety of residents with physical impairments.

                  4751D. An ALF or an ILF may consist of a single building or multiple buildings.

                  4751E. Structures and uses accessory to the ALF of ILF may also be provided (with
                  the exception of covered parking areas) within the same building, including, but not
                  limited to, the following: beauty and barber salons; recreational, physical fitness
                  and therapy services; nondenominational chapel; library; bank automated teller machine;
                  management offices; adult day care or adult day health facility; hospice residence;
                  food service; laundry and covered parking areas; provided, however, that such accessory
                  uses and structures shall be designed for the primary use of the residents and staff
                  of the ALF or ILF. Such accessory uses may not be designed for or used as a general
                  business by the general public. Such accessory uses shall be wholly be within a structure
                  containing residential units, and shall have not exterior advertising display.

                  4751F. The facility shall be served by the municipal water system.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               4760. Conversion of Existing Structures. Applicants are encouraged to convert land and buildings that are no longer needed
               or suitable for their original use, and to permit reuses which are compatible with
               the character of the neighborhood and which take into consideration the interests
               of abutters, neighbors and the public, especially where the site abuts a residential
               area or the building(s) merit preservation.

                  4761. Where conversion of an existing structure is proposed, the standards set forth
                  in Section 4450 shall not apply where the existing structure is nonconforming; provided,
                  however, that any proposed expansion of the existing structure shall conform to the
                  extent feasible.

               (Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

               4770. Action by the Planning Board. The Board may grant a special permit for an ALF/ILF where it makes the following
               findings:

                  4771. The proposed ALF complies with the requirements of this Section;

                  4772. The proposed ALF does not cause substantial detriment to the neighborhood after
                  considering the following potential consequences:

                     (A)

                     noise, during the construction and operational phases;

                     (B)

                     pedestrian and vehicular traffic;

                     (C)

                     environmental harm;

                     (D)

                     visual impact caused by the character and scale of the proposed structure(s).

                  4773. For conversions of existing structures, the Planning Board must find that the
                  proposal protects the City's heritage by minimizing removal or disruption of historic,
                  traditional or significant uses, structures or architectural elements, whether these
                  exist on the site or on adjacent properties. If the building is a municipally owned
                  building, the proposed uses and structures are consistent with any conditions imposed
                  by the Planning Board on the sale, lease, or transfer of the site. The buffer requirements,
                  minimum open space requirements, and building height requirements shall be those physically
                  existing as of [date of enactment]. The Council may permit expansion of the structure
                  to the degree reasonably necessary to comply with federal and state law.

                  accommodate foreseeable users (within a ten-year period), including wireless services
                  providers and local Police, Fire and Ambulance companies, unless the applicant demonstrates
                  to the Zoning Board of Appeals that it is technically infeasible to do so.

                  4952. The height of any facility shall not exceed the height restrictions of the zoning

                  height is necessary to meet the needs of the facility and/or the City. Existing ground
                  elevations may not be altered or distorted in order to achieve additional height.

                  4953. Freestanding facilities shall be set back from the nearest residential dwelling

                  point, including antennas, etc.) and further, said WCF shall not be located closer
                  than twenty-five (25) feet from any street or lot line.

                  4954. WCF may be placed upon or inside existing buildings or structures, including
                  water tanks and towers, church spires, electrical transmission towers, and the like.
                  In such cases, the facility height shall not exceed two (2) feet above the height
                  of the existing structure or building.

                  4955. All structures associated with WCF shall be removed within one year of cessation
                  of use at the expense of the applicant. The Board of Appeals may require a performance
                  guarantee to effect this result, including a bond of an amount to be determined by
                  the Board of Appeals.

                  4956. To the extent feasible, all network interconnections from the communications

                  4957. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent feasible.

                  4958. The facility shall minimize, to the extent feasible, adverse visual effects
                  on the environment. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose reasonable conditions to
                  ensure this result, including painting, lighting standards, landscaping, and screening.

                  4959. Traffic associated with the facility shall not adversely affect public ways.

                  4959A. Fencing may be required to control unauthorized entry to the WCF.

                  from the WCF or components thereon. If interference occurs, the applicant must remedy
                  the interference within the time period affixed by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

                  4959C. The Zoning Board of Appeals may require an applicant to pay for costs incurred
                  by the Board to review the application for a WCF. These costs may include, without
                  limitation, engineering, planning, technical or legal consulting services necessary
                  for review purposes.

                  Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center to operate in the City without
                  first obtaining a special permit from the Planning Board.

                  (ii)

                  A Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center must obtain a new
                  special permit or a modification of its existing special permit for each additional
                  use that is proposed after the initial permitting process.

                  (iii)

                  The special permit requirements set forth in this section shall be in addition to,
                  and not in lieu of, any other licensing and permitting requirements imposed by any

                  No activity shall be conducted at a Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment
                  Center other than that for which the special permit has been issued.

                  (v)

                  A Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center must, prior to seeking
                  a special permit from the Planning Board, file a security plan with the New Bedford
                  Police Department that includes information relating to alarms, fencing, gates, limited
                  access areas, delivery procedures, police details, and video and lighting locations.
                  The security plan shall show the arrangement of pedestrian circulation and access
                  to the public points of entry to the premises from the nearest public or private street
                  or off-street parking area. When Marijuana Establishments and Medical Marijuana Treatment
                  Centers update their security plans, they must share these updates with the New Bedford
                  Police Department. These security plans and updates shall, to the maximum extent permissible

                  A Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center must, prior to seeking
                  a special permit from the Planning Board, file an emergency response plan with the
                  New Bedford Fire, Police, and Health Departments. When Marijuana Establishments and
                  Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers update their emergency response plans, they must
                  share these updates with the New Bedford Fire, Police, and Health Departments. These
                  emergency response plans and updates shall, to the maximum extent permissible under
                  the law, remain confidential.

               4142B. Limit on Number of Marijuana Establishments and Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers.

                  (i)

                  The Planning Board shall limit the number of special permits issued to Marijuana Retailers
                  to 20% of the number of licenses issued within the City under M.G.L.A. c. 138, §15
                  for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on the premises where sold
                  (""the 20% number""). If the 20% number is not a whole number at the time that the Planning
                  Board is considering a special permit application for a Marijuana Retailer, then it
                  shall be rounded up to the next whole number for purposes of determining the maximum
                  allowable number of special permits in the City for Marijuana Retailers. A special
                  permit for a Marijuana Retailer shall not be revoked solely because the total number
                  of special permits issued to Marijuana Retailers in the City exceeds the 20% number
                  due to a reduction in the number of licenses issued within the City under M.G.L.A.
                  c. 138, §15.

                  (ii)

                  into a Host Community Agreement with the City, there shall be no Medical Marijuana
                  Treatment Centers in the City that dispense marijuana or marijuana products to the
                  public.

                  state and any of its agencies, including the Cannabis Control Commission and/or the
                  Department of Public Health, as the case may be. The Planning Board shall not consider
                  or act upon any special permit application that does not demonstrate that the proposed
                  Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center has obtained a preliminary
                  license or provisional certificate of registration from the state or one of its agencies.

               licenses for used car sales, there is hereby imposed a moratorium on Class II used
               car sales permits, other than renewals, for a period of one year. During the term
               of this moratorium (unless earlier terminated by ordinance) the City will not accept
               any permit applications for Class II used car sales. The moratorium imposed by this
               Section shall be in effect for one year commencing on the date of passage.

               5720. Temporary Moratorium on Recreational Marijuana Establishments.

                  5721. Purpose. On November 8, 2016 the voters of the Commonwealth approved a law regulating the
                  cultivation, processing, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for recreational
                  purposes (new M.G.L.A. c. 94G, Regulation of the Use and Distribution of Marijuana
                  Not Medically Prescribed). The law, which allows certain personal use and possession
                  of marijuana, took effect on December 15, 2016 and was amended on December 30, 2016
                  by Chapter 351 of the Acts of 2016 and thereafter, on July 28, 2017 by Chapter 55
                  of the Acts of 2017. The law requires the Cannabis Control Commission (""CCC"") to issue
                  regulations regarding the licensing of commercial activities by March 15, 2018 and
                  to begin accepting applications for licenses no later than April 1, 2018. Currently,
                  the zoning ordinances do not specifically address marijuana establishments as that
                  term is defined in M.G.L.A. c. 94G, §1. The final CCC regulations may provide guidance
                  on certain aspects of local regulation of marijuana establishments. The regulation
                  of non-medical marijuana raises novel legal, planning, and public safety issues, and
                  the City needs time to study and consider these issues, as well as to address the
                  potential impact of the CCC regulations on local zoning and, in connection therewith,
                  to undertake a planning process to consider amending the zoning ordinances to regulate
                  marijuana establishments. The City intends to adopt a temporary moratorium on the
                  use of land and structures for recreational marijuana establishments so as to allow
                  sufficient time to address the effects of such structures and uses in the City and
                  to enact ordinances in a consistent manner.

                  5722. Definition. ""Marijuana Establishment"" shall mean a marijuana cultivator, independent testing
                  laboratory, marijuana product manufacturer, marijuana retailer or any other type of
                  licensed marijuana-related business, all as defined for purposes of M.G.L.A. c. 94G,
                  §1.

                  5723. Temporary Moratorium. For the reasons set forth above and notwithstanding any other provision of the zoning
                  ordinances to the contrary, the City hereby adopts a temporary moratorium on the use
                  of land or structures for a marijuana establishment and other uses related to non-medical
                  marijuana. The moratorium shall be in effect through September 30, 2018 or until such
                  time as the City adopts a zoning ordinance relating to marijuana establishments, whichever
                  occurs first. During the moratorium period the City shall undertake a planning process
                  to address the potential impacts of marijuana establishments and shall consider adopting
                  zoning ordinances in response to these new issues or take any action relative thereto.

               buildings on the same side of the street, the average setback alignment of corresponding
               stories within two hundred (200) feet on each side of and directly opposite the lot
               shall govern. One street frontage of a corner lot shall have a clear depth of no less
               than ten (10) feet, in which case this distance shall not be considered in determining
               the front yard depths on such street. Nothing in this chapter shall require any building
               hereafter erected between two (2) existing buildings or immediately adjacent lots
               to set back from the street a greater distance than that one of such two (2) existing
               buildings which is farther from the street line.

               removal has become a significant expense of the city. It is intended that persons
               responsible for such expenses shall bear the costs of same. In order to recover the
               cost of litter removal, the city, through its health department, may bring a civil
               action against any person believed to be responsible for depositing litter. The city
               may, in order to avoid the necessity of the institution of such action, make an offer
               of settlement to any person believed to be responsible for depositing litter. If the
               settlement offer is accepted, no action will be instituted by the city.

                  agent of the city, to make to any person believed to be responsible for damaging the
                  city by depositing litter within the city, an offer of settlement.

                  (2)

                  The health department shall determine a standard amount of the settlement offer authorized
                  to be made by this section. In determining the standard amount of the settlement offer,
                  the health department shall consider only such factors as may reasonably be considered
                  when any individual offer of settlement is determined.

                  (3)

                  The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed to require that a settlement
                  offer be made if the amount of damage caused by the litter being deposited in the
                  city is significantly greater than the standard amount of the settlement offer determined
                  by the health department pursuant to the subsection (2) hereof.

               within the limits of the City of New Bedford is unlawful and subject to penalties
               as set forth herein.

               The abandonment of a motor vehicle or other vehicle or any part thereof on private
               or public property, other than a highway, in view of the general public, anywhere
               in the city is unlawful. A motor vehicle or other vehicles or any part thereof so
               abandoned on private property not that of the owner may be authorized for removal
               by or upon the order of the inspector of buildings, after a waiting period of forty-eight
               (48) hours.

               When a motor vehicle or other vehicle or part thereof is abandoned on a highway in
               the city ten (10) hours or more, its removal may be authorized by the chief of police.

               When an abandoned, unattended, wrecked, burned, or partially dismantled motor vehicle
               or other vehicle is creating a traffic hazard because of its position in relation
               to the highway or its physical appearance is causing the impeding of traffic, its
               immediate removal from the highway may be authorized by order of the chief of police.

               When a vehicle removed from either public or private property is authorized by order
               of the chief of police or the inspector of buildings, the owner of the vehicle will
               be responsible for all towing costs.

               When a motor vehicle or other vehicle abandoned on a highway is authorized to be towed
               away, the police department shall keep and maintain a record of the vehicle towed,
               listing the color, year of manufacture, manufacturer's trade name, manufacturer's
               series name, body style, vehicle identification number, and license plate year and
               number displayed on the vehicle. The record shall also include the date and hour of
               tow, location towed from, location towed to, reason for towing and the name of the
               office authorizing the tow.

               When the police department does not know the identity of the registered owner or other
               legally entitled person, they will cause the motor vehicle registration records to
               be searched by a directed communication to the registrar of motor vehicles for the
               purpose of obtaining the required ownership information.

               The police department will cause the stolen motor vehicle files of the state police
               to be searched by a directed communication to the state police for stolen or wanted
               information on the vehicle. When the state police files are searched with negative
               results, the information contained in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
               files will be requested of the state police. The information determined from these
               record searches will be used by the police department in sending a notification by
               certified mail to the owner or legally entitled person, advising where the vehicle
               is held.

               When the registered owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of a
               motor vehicle or other vehicle abandoned on a highway or public property cannot be
               identified from the registration files of the commonwealth or from the registration
               files of another state, the police department shall notify the state police for the
               purpose of identifying the vehicle's owner or other person legally entitled to the
               possession of the vehicle.

               The owner or other person legally entitled to possession may reclaim the vehicle by
               presenting to the police department proof of ownership or proof of the right to possession
               of the vehicle. No vehicle shall be released to the owner or other person under this
               section until all towing and storage charges have been paid.

               Whenever an abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed motor vehicle, seven (7) years of
               age or newer, remains unclaimed by the registered owner or other person legally entitled
               to its possession for a period of thirty (30) days after notice has been given as
               provided herein, the police department shall cause it to be sold at public sale to
               the highest bidder. Notice of the time and place of the sale shall be posted in a
               conspicuous place for at least ten (10) days prior to the sale on the premises where
               the vehicle has been impounded. At least ten (10) days prior to the sale, the police
               department shall cause a notice of the time and place of the sale to be sent by certified
               mail to the registered owner or other person known by the police department to be
               legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle. Such notice shall contain a complete
               description of the vehicle to be sold and what steps must be taken by any legally
               entitled person to reclaim the vehicle.

               In those instances where the certified notification specified herein has been returned
               by the postal authorities to the police department due to the addressee having moved,
               or being unknown at the address obtained from the registration records of this state,
               the sending of a second certified notice will not be required.

               When the identity of the registered owner or other person legally entitled to the
               possession of an abandoned, lost, or unclaimed vehicle cannot be determined by any
               means provided for in this section, the vehicle may be sold as provided herein or
               disposed of in the manner authorized by this section without notice to the registered
               owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle.

               When a motor vehicle or other vehicle in the custody of the police department is reclaimed
               by the registered owner or other legally entitled person, or when the vehicle is sold
               at public sale or otherwise disposed of as provided by this section, a report of the
               transaction will be retained by the police department for a period of one year from
               the date of the sale or disposal.

               When a vehicle located within the limits of the city is authorized to be towed away
               by the chief of police and disposed of as set forth in this section, the proceeds
               of the public sale or disposition after the deduction of towing, storage and processing
               charges shall be paid into the treasury.

               Any police officer, towing service owner, operator, or employee shall not be held
               to answer or be liable for damages in any action brought by the registered owner,
               former registered owner, or his legal representative, or any other person legally
               entitled to the possession of a motor vehicle or other vehicle when the vehicle was
               processed and sold or disposed of as provided by this section.

               Pending final action upon such charges, the mayor with the approval of the city council

               Preamble.

               Whereas, a serious public emergency exists with respect to the housing of a substantial
               number of citizens of New Bedford; and

               Whereas, the deterioration and demolition of existing housing and an insufficient
               supply of new rental housing have resulted in a substantial and critical shortage
               of safe, decent, and reasonable priced rental housing accommodations; and

               Whereas, the prolonged increases in housing costs at a rate substantially exceeding
               increases in personal income, the increased costs of new housing construction and
               the conversion of multiple unit rental housing accommodations occupied by tenants
               to condominium units and cooperatives has resulted in a substantial and critical shortage
               of safe, decent, and reasonably priced housing accommodations; and

               Whereas, home ownership creates an interest in real estate which tends to contribute
               to the maintenance and preservation of housing and to an increase in real estate taxes
               which has a salutary effect on the city and its people, and the city council should,
               therefore, encourage an increase in such ownership or at least should avoid discouraging
               it; and

               Whereas, at present in the city there is a great interest in and a significant amount
               of conversions of multiple unit rental housing occupied by tenants to condominium
               units or cooperatives occupied by individual owners thereof; and

               Whereas, notwithstanding the general good accomplished by such increase in home ownership,
               many people of limited means, particularly the elderly, the handicapped, and persons
               and families of low and moderate income, are suffering thereby in that they have difficulty
               in obtaining alternative rental housing at prices which they can afford when evicted
               for condominium conversion; and

               Whereas, the untoward effects of condominium conversion evictions on tenants can be
               adequately dealt with by providing potentially displaced tenants with sufficient time
               to examine the housing market, evaluate available housing alternatives, formulate
               future housing plans, secure any necessary financing and decide whether to purchase
               the condominium unit or relocate; and

               Whereas, this emergency cannot be dealt with solely by the operation of the private
               rental housing market, and unless evictions for condominium conversions and cooperatives
               are regulated and controlled, such emergency and the inflationary pressures and displacement
               resulting therefrom will produce serious threats to the public health, safety, and
               general welfare of the citizens of New Bedford;

               Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in it by law, including without limitation,
               Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, as amended by Chapter 170 of the Acts of 1984, be

               If a building submitted to the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 183A, c. 156B, c. 157, c.
               157B or any provisions of the Massachusetts General laws governing the cooperative
               form of ownership has been used in whole or in part for residential purposes within
               one year prior to the recording of a master deed creating a condominium or the filing
               of the articles of organization creating a housing cooperative, the owner thereof
               shall give each tenant of all housing accommodations in such building or buildings
               notice of intent to convert the building or buildings to the condominium or cooperative
               form of ownership. Such notice shall state in clear and conspicuous language the following
               in English, Spanish, and Portuguese:

               a.

               That the owner has filed or intends to file a master deed at the registry of deeds
               whose location is stated in the notice or has filed or intends to file articles of
               organization with the secretary of the commonwealth;

               b.

               That any tenant residing on the date the notice of intent is given in the building
               or buildings converted or to be converted to the condominium or cooperative forms
               of ownership shall have a period of time which shall be stated in the notice, from
               the date of receipt of such notice, as authorized by this act, before the tenant shall
               be required to vacate the housing accommodation occupied on the date the notice is
               received;

               c.

               That any tenant residing on the date the notice of intent was given in the building
               or buildings to be converted shall have a period of time, which shall be stated in
               the notice, from the date of receipt of such notice, as authorized by this section,
               to purchase the unit occupied by the tenant on the date the notice is received on
               terms and conditions which are substantially the same as or more favorable than those
               which the owner extends to the public generally for the ninety (90) days following
               the expiration of said tenants right to purchase as may be required by paragraph (2).

               All notices required under this section shall be deemed to have been given when a
               written notice is delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return
               receipt requested, to the party to whom the notice is being given.

               Whenever an owner is required to give notice of intent provided for in this section
               the period of notice shall not be less than the expiration of any written agreement
               between the owner and the tenant of the housing accommodation which governs the use
               and occupancy of said housing accommodation or one year from the date the tenant of
               such housing accommodation is given said notice of intent, whichever is greater; provided,
               however, that in the case of a housing accommodation occupied in whole or in part
               by a handicapped tenant or occupied by an elderly or low or moderate income tenant
               the period of notice shall not be less than two (2) years from the date the tenant
               of such housing accommodation received said notice of intent.

               No person shall bring any action seeking a condominium or cooperative eviction until
               the expiration of the periods of time for notice to tenants specified in this section.

               The burden of proving qualifications with respect to age, handicap, and income shall
               rest with the tenant.

               (2)

               Any owner of residential property who converts such property to the condominium or
               cooperative form of ownership shall give to any tenant who is entitled to receive
               notice pursuant to this section the right to purchase the housing accommodation occupied
               by such tenant at the time such notice is delivered on terms and conditions which
               are substantially the same as or more favorable than those which the owner extends
               to the public generally for the ninety (90) days following the expiration of said
               tenant's right to purchase. Such tenant may exercise a right to purchase such housing
               accommodations by executing a purchase and sale agreement prior to the expiration
               of ninety (90) days after the date of receiving a copy of the purchase and sale agreement
               properly executed by the person offering the housing accommodation for sale.

               (3)

               The owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form
               of ownership shall pay to any tenant who is entitled to receive a notice pursuant
               to this section and who does not purchase the housing accommodation which he occupies
               or another housing accommodation in the same building or buildings relocation benefits
               for the actual, documented costs of moving, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars
               ($750.00) per housing accommodation; provided, that if such housing accommodation
               is occupied in whole or in part by a handicapped tenant or is occupied by an elderly
               or low or moderate income tenant the maximum relocation benefit shall not exceed one
               thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per housing accommodation. Such relocation benefits shall
               be payable within ten (10) days after the date on which the tenant vacates the housing
               accommodation occupied by him; provided, however, that no tenant shall be eligible
               for such relocation benefits unless all rent due and payable for said unit under the
               rental agreement or extension of such agreement, if any, has been paid by the tenant
               prior to the date on which the housing accommodation is vacated and only as long as
               the tenant voluntarily vacates the housing accommodation for which recovery of possession
               is sought on or before the expiration of the notice period.

               (4)

               Any owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form
               of ownership shall assist elderly, handicapped and low or moderate income tenants
               who qualified as such as of the date of receipt of the notice authorized pursuant
               to this section locating, within the period of the notice to such tenants, comparable
               rental housing within the same city or town in which such tenant resides which rents
               for a sum which is equal to or less than the sum which such tenant had been paying
               for the housing accommodation occupied at the time of receipt of the notice authorized
               by this section. The failure of the owner of such residential property to find such
               substitute housing accommodation shall extend the period of notice for up to an additional
               two (2) years.

               (5)

               Any owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form
               of ownership shall give to any tenant who is entitled to receive a notice pursuant
               to this section an extension of the rental agreement at the expiration thereof. Such
               extension, where required, shall be for such period or periods of one year or such
               fraction thereof as shall equal the period of notice to which such tenant is entitled
               pursuant to the provisions of this section. The provisions of such rental agreement
               may not otherwise be modified by the property owner except with respect to the amount
               of annual rent, any increase in which shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum
               which would result by multiplying said rent by the percentage increase in the consumer
               price index for all urban consumers as published by the United States Department of
               Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, during the calendar year immediately preceding
               the date upon which such rental agreement is commenced, or ten (10) percent, whichever
               is less; provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the right of a property owner
               to any amounts which may be due under a valid tax escalation clause.

               (d)

               Punishment, enforcement. In accordance with the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, Section 5, any owner who converts
               residential property in violation of any provisions of the ordinance, adopted pursuant
               to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one
               thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment of not less than sixty (60) days.
               Each unit covered in violation of this section constitutes a separate offense.

               Any violation of this section adopted pursuant to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, by
               an owner of residential property shall not affect the validity of a conveyance of
               a condominium unit or an interest in a housing cooperative to a purchaser for value
               who has no knowledge of the violation.

               The district and superior courts, in the City of New Bedford and Bristol County, shall
               have jurisdiction over any action arising from any violation of this section adopted
               pursuant to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, and shall have jurisdiction in equity to
               restrain any such violation.

               triplicate, as the fish or other seafood is unloaded, which shall be signed by the
               public weigher or deputy weigher, a representative of the selling vessel and a representative
               of the buyer, after landing and prior to the removal of the fish or seafood from the
               immediate unloading area. No fish shall be removed from the immediate loading area
               until a tally sheet recording the same has been completed and signed (or punched or

               ($10.00) for balancing scales during the unloading of one vessel. The public weigher
               and the deputy weighers may and should remove ice and other debris accumulating on
               such devices, and shall alert all parties as soon as any such device being used, or
               to be used, is observed reading other than zero, or not in balance when no fish or
               other seafood is then upon such device. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
               derogate, lessen or supersede the powers, duties and authority of the sealer of weights

               has been transported from the immediate unloading area without a tally sheet having
               been completed, including being signed by the public weigher or deputy weigher, and
               the representatives of the selling vessel and the buyer, the public weigher or deputy
               weigher's totals shall be conclusive evidence of the same, admissible in any court

               consists of submitting a completed application form, payment of the annual licensing
               fee, proof of insurance and any and all information contained in the application.

               (hereinafter referred to as ""interested city departments""), within forty-five (45)
               business days of the submittal of the completed application and will issue a determination
               within sixty (60) business days of the submittal of the completed application. In
               the event the application is incomplete or deficient, the commissioner will promptly
               notify the applicant of any deficiencies.

               (c)

               For those serving alcohol. Applicants that do/will serve alcoholic beverages must complete the permit application
               process and, in addition, seek and secure approval from the City of New Bedford Licensing
               Board and Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) Alcohol Beverage.

               (1)

               Every outdoor café on a city public right-of-way shall be temporary in nature and
               designed so that the entire café structure and its appurtenances include, but not
               limited to, chairs, tables, fencing, bollards and planters can be easily removed during
               periods of non-use. There will be no permanent fixtures in the public right-of-way.
               Furthermore, the city reserves the right to require the user to remove the outdoor
               café if and when it determines it to be necessary, even during the term of the license.
               The license is available only to a holder of a common victualer license.

               (2)

               Location of outdoor café:

               a.

               The outdoor café must be contiguous to a licensed restaurant facility located on a
               street level. The outdoor café area may not extend beyond the frontage and/or side
               faces of the licensed restaurant.

               b.

               There must be at least four (4) feet of free unimpeded pedestrian passageway on the
               sidewalk. However, the city reserves the right to require that more than four (4)
               feet of outdoor be made available during certain hours of the day, or days of the
               week in order to accommodate pedestrian traffic.

               c.

               When located on private property, outdoor cafes must be adjacent to the premises to
               which the outdoor cafe is accessory but may be located in front of, on the side of
               and/or to the rear of the premises. Such cafes shall be required to comply with all
               applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the Americans
               with Disabilities Act.

               (3)

               Limitations on use.

               a.

               Service of alcohol. If alcohol is served at an outdoor café, necessary permits and/or licenses from the
               licensing board must be obtained. In an area where alcohol is served, the seating
               area must be separated from the pedestrian walk space with a system of enclosure,
               such as decorative fencing, planters or removable bollards.

               b.

               No portion of an outdoor café may be used for any purpose other than seated dining
               or circulation. Outdoor cafés must serve food. No one shall be seated in an outdoor
               café for the sole purpose of drinking alcohol, nor can the outdoor café be used as
               a place for patrons to drink while standing.

               c.

               The outdoor café area cannot be used for smoking.

               d.

               All outdoor café areas shall be maintained in good order and no refuse and no refuse
               containers are allowed within the area.

               e.

               All outdoor activity must cease at the close of business or midnight; whichever is
               earlier or otherwise regulated by the City of New Bedford Licensing Board and Massachusetts
               Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) Alcohol Beverage, as applicable.

               f.

               All outdoor cafés must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and
               regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. A minimum unobstructed
               passageway from end of use (parallel to street) of not less than four (4) feet in
               width at all points will be required.

               g.

               The applicant who applies for an outdoor café permit shall bear all financial responsibility
               for any and all improvements necessary to the public space, both within and surrounding
               the outdoor café area. At no time and for no reason shall public funds be expended
               for improvements designed to benefit the licensee.

               h.

               The license shall address liability, liability insurance, maintenance and trash removal
               concerns, and set forth the rental cost for the licensing of the public space.

               i.

               Commercial general liability insurance must be procured and maintained on an ""occurrence
               basis"" in such amounts as the city solicitor's office shall from time to time determine
               to be required. This coverage shall include an endorsement naming the city, including
               all elected and appointed officials, all employees, all boards, commissions and/or
               authorities and board members as an additional insured. This coverage must be primary,
               and any other insurance maintained by the additional insured shall be considered to
               be excess and non-contributing with this insurance, and shall include an endorsement
               providing for a 30-day advance written notice of cancellation or non-renewal to send
               to the city solicitor and the department of inspectional services. The city on a yearly
               basis shall determine the fee for the license. The certificate of insurance will be
               provided to the department of inspectional services prior to the issuance of license.

               j.

               Vaults. The department of public infrastructure shall determine whether there is a vault
               under the outdoor area proposed to be used for the outdoor café. In the event that
               there is an underground vault, the applicant shall not obtain a license for the outdoor
               café until such time as the applicant has obtained a certification from a licensed
               structural engineer that the area over the vault is structurally strong enough to
               support the use as a café.

               k.

               Length of license agreement. The license agreement for the use of the public space shall be an annual license
               that shall expire December 31
               
                  st
                  
               of each year.

               l.

               Fee for permitting public space. The department of inspectional services is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations
               governing the use of outdoor cafés spaces including the license fee for use of the
               public space. The fee is subject to change on a periodic basis.

               m.

               Renewals. An application for renewal of an outdoor café license shall be made to the department
               of inspectional services. For license applications made by establishments not serving
               alcohol and not requiring the approval of the licensing board, provided no complaints
               have been made to the department of inspectional services, renewal will be allowed
               as an administrative process requiring the sign-off of each interested city department
               per this section. For license applications made by establishments serving alcohol,
               licensing board approval is required each year prior to the initiation of the administrative
               process requiring the sign off of each interested city department.

               n.

               Permits issued for outdoor cafés by the department of inspectional services will require
               that the user adhere to all applicable rules, regulations and laws governing the use
               of public space, and the operation of the café. Licenses will be subject to renewal
               on a yearly basis. The city reserves the right to revoke the license for any reason
               and at any time.

               o.

               By accepting a license issued pursuant to this section, the licensee shall be solely
               responsible for any and all costs of whatever kind and nature relating to the outdoor

               and shall further authorize the conservation commission to amend said fee schedule
               as needed, to reflect the expenditures for administrative and technical staff review

               or inundation by groundwater or surface water.

               Resource areas protected under this article shall mean all wetland resource areas
               protected in M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40 and its regulations: 310 CMR 10.00 et seq. The
               conservation commission will also work with each individual applicant to achieve up
               to a twenty-five-foot setback from resource areas, however this twenty-five-foot setback
               is not a mandate of this article. Science and conservation commission experience have

               responsibility for the maintenance of the common building sewer, from the point where
               the individual building sewers combine to the point of discharge into the public sewer
               or other place of disposal.

               Such agreement shall be in writing, it shall be binding on the current owners of the
               properties together with their heirs and assigns, it shall be recorded in the Registry
               of Deeds for Bristol County, Southern District, and a copy thereof showing the date,
               book, and page of recording shall be delivered to the city engineer before a permit
               to connect such common building sewer to the public sanitary sewer can be given.

               (f)

               Old building sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are
               found, on examination and test by the city engineer, to meet all the requirements
               of this article.

               (g)

               Conformance to codes. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the
               methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling
               the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing codes
               and other applicable rules and regulations of the city. In the absence of code provisions
               or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth by the city engineer
               shall apply.

               (h)

               Building sanitary sewer; lift. Whenever possible, the building sanitary sewer shall be brought to the building at
               an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which the building sanitary
               drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sanitary sewer, sewage carried
               by such building sanitary drain may be lifted by a suitable means and discharged to
               the public sanitary sewer through a building sewer designed to accept such pressurized
               discharge. The lifting device and attendant discharge piping shall be approved by
               the city engineer and commissioner.

               The property owner(s) shall bear all responsibility and liability, financial or otherwise,
               for the procurement, installation, operation, and maintenance of said lift or equivalent
               device. The city shall be held harmless in the event of any actions or claims arising
               out of the installation and use of said device and the commissioner shall have full
               authority to impose such rules and regulations as may be considered necessary to protect
               the city's sewage works from deleterious effects resulting from the installation and/or
               operation of such devices.

               In all cases where such lift devices or pumps are used, the discharge shall be piped
               to a manhole located on a gravity sewer line unless written authorization is granted
               by the city engineer and commissioner. Under no circumstances shall a pressure discharge
               pipe from a lift device or pump be connected to a building sanitary sewer serving
               another building.

               (i)

               Surface run-off. No person shall make connection of roof down spouts, exterior foundation drains,
               areaway drains, or other sources of surface run-off or groundwater to a building sanitary
               drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer
               unless written authorization is granted by the city engineer and commissioner.

               (j)

               Procedures and materials standards. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements
               of the building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and regulations of the
               city, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society
               for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) Manual
               of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gas tight and watertight. Any
               deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the city
               engineer and commissioner before the installation.

               (k)

               Notice for inspection; supervision of connection. Contractors installing building sewers and/or storm drains shall notify the city
               engineer at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time when the building sewer
               and/or building storm drain is expected to be ready for inspection. The installation
               shall be made under the supervision of the city engineer or a duly authorized representative.

               (l)

               Guarding excavations; restoration of street, etc., surface. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with
               barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks,
               parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored
               in a manner satisfactory to the city.

               of the ground or discharge it in such a way that permits it to come to the surface
               of the ground.

               It shall be prohibited to discharge to any natural outlet except where suitable treatment
               has been provided in accordance with the subsequent provisions of this Regulation
               of via a NPDES permit.

               The owners of every building designed or regularly used for human habitation or congregation
               shall provide on the premises a sanitary method of sewage disposal for the exclusive
               use of those persons who regularly use the building and/or transient member of the
               public. The owner shall comply with this requirement by providing connections to a

               meter using the rates in effect at the time. In addition, all users shall pay a base
               rate established periodically.

                  (a)

                  Discharge of surface water, etc., to sanitary sewer prohibited. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water,
                  groundwater, roof run-off, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
                  industrial process waters to any public sanitary sewer unless written authorization
                  is granted by the commissioner.

                  (b)

                  Disposition of stormwater, etc. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such drains as
                  are specifically designated as storm drains, or to a natural outlet approved by the
                  city engineer. Unpolluted industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may
                  be discharged, on approval of the commissioner, to a storm drain, combined sewer or
                  natural outlet.

                  (c)

                  Prohibited discharges to public sewer. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described
                  waters or wastes to any public sewers:

                  vi.

                  Any noxious or malodorous gas, liquid, solid, or other wastewater which, either singly
                  or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a
                  hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair;

                  vii.

                  Any sludges or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes;

                  viii.

                  Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test;

                  ix.

                  Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which
                  may cause excessive foaming in the POTW;

                  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction
                  by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such
                  degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other
                  agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.

                  (10)

                  Any discharge of hauled or trucked pollutants without permission from the commissioner.

                  (11)

                  Any form of dilution, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment,
                  to comply with a pretreatment standard or requirement is prohibited unless expressly
                  authorized by an applicable standard or requirement; in either case, approval must
                  be granted by the city.

                  (12)

                  Options of commissioner as to certain wastes. If any waters or wastes are discharged
                  or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances
                  or possess the characteristics enumerated above and which in the judgment of the commissioner,
                  may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
                  waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance,
                  the commissioner may:

                  i.

                  Reject/immediately halt the wastes;

                  ii.

                  Require the development of a compliance schedule, to include milestones and progress
                  reports, by each IU for installation of technology required to meet a pretreatment
                  standard or requirement. At a minimum, with final frequency determined by the commissioner,
                  within fourteen (14) days of a milestone in the compliance schedule and within fourteen
                  (14) days of the final date for compliance, the IU must submit a progress report to
                  the POTW indicating whether or not the milestone or final compliance date was met
                  and, if not, when compliance with that increment of progress is expected;

                  iii.

                  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

                  iv.

                  by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of this ordinance.

                  (13)

                  Requirements as to treatment or equalization facilities. If the commissioner permits
                  the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of all
                  equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the commissioner, and subject
                  to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

                  (14)

                  Interceptors. Grease, oil, sand and/or other interceptors shall be provided when,
                  in the opinion of the commissioner, they are necessary for the proper handling of
                  liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand
                  or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
                  for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type
                  and capacity approved by the commissioner, shall be located so as to be readily and
                  easily accessible for cleaning and inspection, and shall comply with section 16-37.

                  (15)

                  Maintenance of treatment or equalizing facilities. Where preliminary treatment or
                  flow-equalizing facilities are required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
                  continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner who shall bear all
                  costs for same.

                  (16)

                  Control manholes, etc. When required by the commissioner or the city engineer, the
                  owner of any property serviced by a building sanitary sewer shall install a suitable
                  control manhole together with such meters, and other appurtenances in the building
                  sewer as are necessary to facilitate observations, sampling and measurement of the
                  wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall
                  be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the commissioner. The manhole
                  and equipment shall be installed by the owner at said owner's expense, and shall be
                  maintained by the owner so as to be safe, accessible and in good working condition
                  at all times.

                  (17)

                  Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics
                  of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined
                  in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and shall be determined at the control manhole
                  provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that
                  no special manhole(s) has/have been required, the control manhole shall be considered
                  to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
                  building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR
                  Part 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine
                  the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved
                  will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises
                  is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but
                  not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites
                  of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. The commissioner
                  may use a grab sample to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards at any
                  time.

                  (18)

                  Special agreements and arrangements. No statement contained in this article shall
                  be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and
                  any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
                  may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial
                  concern, provided such agreements do not violate the provisions of Federal Pretreatment
                  Standards (40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403).

                  (e)

                  Upon the promulgation of national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
                  industrial subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations
                  imposed in this document, shall immediately supersede any limit imposed by this article.

                  (f)

                  No person shall discharge wastewater containing any pollutant specified in Appendix
                  A, annexed hereto, and incorporated herein by reference, in excess of the limitations
                  for each of said pollutants as specified in said Appendix A. Compliance with the provisions
                  of this section shall be assessed on the basis of samples of the person's wastewater
                  discharge collected at each point of connection between the person's building, structure,
                  facility or installation and the facility's sewage system. If a national categorical
                  pretreatment standard establishes limitations for industrial users in a particular
                  industrial subcategory which are more stringent than the limitations specified in
                  Appendix A, those more stringent limitations shall immediately apply to those users
                  subject to that national categorical pretreatment standard. Compliance with national
                  categorical pretreatment standards shall be assessed in accordance with the requirements
                  set forth in 40 CFR 403.12

               drain or public sanitary sewer shall become clogged, obstructed, broken, out of order
               or detrimental to the use of said storm drain or sewer, or unfit for the purpose of
               drainage, the owner or other person having charge of any building, yard, lot of land,
               or other premises which are drained by said private storm drain or sewer shall, within
               five (5) days after notice in writing from the commissioner or the city engineer,
               remove, reconstruct, alter, cleanse or repair said private storm drain or private
               sewer, as the condition thereof may require. In case of neglect or refusal to remove,
               reconstruct, repair, alter or cleanse said private storm drain or private sewer within
               such space of five (5) days, and in the event such neglect or refusal causes or threatens
               to cause a public nuisance or danger to public health and welfare, the city engineer
               or commissioner may proceed by whatever means may be required, up to and including
               a court order, if necessary, to force compliance with the above directive. All costs
               and expenses arising out of such enforcement and rectification shall be borne by the
               owner(s) or person(s) in charge.

               (b)

               Private sewers are the property and responsibility of the property owner. Should said
               private sewer become obstructed, the property owner bears all responsibility to clear
               said blockage unless the public sewer main is at fault, in which case the city will

               All persons discharging into the public sewer system shall comply with applicable
               requirements of federal, state and local industrial pretreatment standards. Industrial
               users shall comply with federal, state and local pretreatment standards and applicable
               categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found in
               40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference.
               Certain users are now or shall become subject to categorical pretreatment standards
               promulgated by the EPA, specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutant properties
               which may be discharged to the POTW.

               (b)

               The commissioner may immediately halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants reasonably
               appearing to present an imminent endangerment to the health and welfare of persons,
               or any discharge presenting, or which may present, an endangerment to the environment,
               or which threatens to interfere with operation of the city's sewage works.

               (c)

               Actions which the commissioner may take to effect the above, include, but are not
               limited to, seeking ex parte temporary injunctive relief, entry on private property,
               blockage of a private sewer to halt such discharge, or demand of specific action by
               the discharger, etc.

               (d)

               In those instances where a discharge presents an imminent endangerment to the health
               and welfare of persons, the commissioner shall make informal notice to the discharger.
               Otherwise the commissioner shall provide the discharger with formal notice, and shall
               provide an opportunity for correction of the discharge.

               (e)

               The commissioner shall notify industrial users of categorical pretreatment standards
               and any applicable requirements under Section 204(d) and 405 of the Clean Water Act
               (33 U.S.C. 466 et seq.) and subtitles C and D of the Resource Recovery and Conservation
               Act, as amended (42 USC 4901 et seq.).

               (f)

               The commissioner shall randomly sample and analyze the discharge of industrial users
               and conduct monitoring and inspection activities to identify, independent of information
               supplied by such persons, occasional and continuing noncompliance with this article
               (as amended). The commissioner shall comply with the public participation requirements
               of 40 CFR Part 25 in the enforcement of industrial pretreatment standards and requirements.

               (g)

               All industrial users must apply for an industrial discharge permit. Such application
               shall be made by completing a form developed by the commissioner. The permit shall
               contain, at a minimum, the following five (5) conditions: (1) a statement of duration;
               (2) a statement of nontransferability; (3) applicable federal, state and local effluent
               limits; (4) self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record keeping
               requirements; and (5) a statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties. No industrial
               user shall discharge to the POTW without an industrial discharge permit and shall
               conform to the conditions of this permit. The terms of an industrial permit may be
               modified by the commissioner and a reasonable time period will be provided for compliance
               with modifications. Violation of any of the conditions of the permit are violations
               of this ordinance.

               Any existing industrial user located outside of New Bedford, yet discharging into
               New Bedford's collection system, shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application
               in accordance within this ordinance.

               The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the neighboring jurisdiction in
               which the industrial user is located to provide for the implementation and enforcement
               of pretreatment program requirements against said industrial user.

               (h)

               All new industrial users shall apply for an industrial discharge permit at least sixty
               (60) calendar days before connecting to the city's sewage works. As part of such application,
               the commissioner may require the applicant to obtain written certification from the
               appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies as to whether the applicant falls
               within particular industrial categories or subcategories for purposes of industrial
               pretreatment standards.

               (i)

               Within ninety (90) calendar days after the adoption by a federal or state regulatory
               agency of a categorical pretreatment standard, existing industrial users subject to
               such standards shall submit a categorical discharge permit application containing
               information required under applicable federal and state industrial pretreatment reporting
               regulations in the form required by the commissioner. (Such categorical discharge
               permit application is in addition to the industrial discharge permit application required
               above.) such information, at a minimum, shall include:

               (1)

               The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operators and owners;

               (2)

               A list of all environmental permits held by or for the facility;

               (3)

               A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial
               classification of the operations carried out at such facility;

               (4)

               A statement reviewed by an authorized representative of the IU, and certified by a
               qualified professional about the user's compliance with applicable categorical standards
               and whether any pretreatment or O &amp; M (schedule included) is required to attain compliance;

               (5)

               Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons
               per day, to the public sewer from regulated process streams and from other streams;

               (6)

               An identification of the industrial pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated
               process; and

               (7)

               An analysis identifying the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge;

               The commissioner may require additional information to be included in such permit
               application.

               (j)

               Beginning one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the adoption of federal or
               state categorical pretreatment standards, industrial users subject to such categorical
               pretreatment standards may not discharge industrial wastes from processes regulated
               by such categorical standards to a public sewer, unless a categorical discharge permit
               application is approved by the commissioner and the terms of any permit modification
               are being met;

               (k)

               Within ninety (90) days after the date for final compliance by existing industrial
               users with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
               source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the public sewer,
               as well as any noncategorical significant industry, such industrial users shall submit
               a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge from
               the regulated process(es) governed by categorical pretreatment standards and the average
               and maximum daily flow for these process units. Such report shall state whether the
               applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
               what additional operation and maintenance practices or pretreatment is necessary.
               Such industrial users shall also submit a report to the city before June 30 and December
               30 each year, unless required more frequently by the commissioner. The report shall
               indicate the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited
               by a pretreatment standard and include a record of measured or estimated average daily
               flows. The report shall be reviewed by an authorized representative of the IU and
               verified by a qualified professional. Industrial users shall immediately notify the
               commissioner of any slug or any discharge with the potential to adversely affect the
               POTW, discharged by such user. In addition, all IU's must notify (in writing) the
               POTW, the state and EPA of any discharge which would be considered a hazardous waste,
               if disposed of in a different manner. The city has the legal authority to require
               any siu to develop a slug control plan, outlining discharge practices; describing
               stored chemicals; and containing procedures to notify the POTW immediately of slug
               discharges.

               Requirements for reports and applications, shall be as follows:

                  (1)

                  All reports and applications (to include, but not limited to, BMR's, ninety-day compliance
                  reports and periodic compliance reports) must be signed by an authorized representative,
                  attesting to the integrity of the analytical data submitted. An authorized representative
                  may be:

                  i.

                  A principal executive officer of at least a level of vice president, if the industrial
                  user is a corporation;

                  ii.

                  A general partner or the proprietor, if the industrial user is a partnership or sole
                  proprietorship; or

                  iii.

                  A duly authorized representative of either of the individuals designated above, if
                  such representative is responsible for the overall operation of the subject facility.

                  (2)

                  Some industries may, at the discretion of the commissioner, be required to perform
                  self-monitoring based on process changes or the nature and/or quantity of wastewater
                  discharge. In the event that an industry is required to perform self-monitoring, the
                  industry shall at all times maintain in good working order all treatment and control
                  facilities. The industry shall take all reasonable steps to minimize any adverse impact
                  to the city sewer system resulting from noncompliance. If the industry monitors any
                  pollutant more frequently than required, this monitoring shall be submitted upon request
                  by the commissioner. If sampling by an IU indicates a violation, the user must notify
                  the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
                  must also resample and submit results of this resampling to the POTW within thirty
                  (30) days.

                  All user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain
                  the following certification statement:

                  I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared
                     under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that
                     qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based
                     on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
                     responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best
                     of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are
                     significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility
                     of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

                  (3)

                  Industrial users subject to the reporting requirement of this ordinance shall maintain
                  records of information resulting from monitoring activities required to prepare such
                  reports. Such records shall be maintained for a minimum of three years, or longer
                  in the case of unresolved litigation or when requested by the commissioner. All pollutant
                  analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with 40
                  CFR 136. If 40 CFR 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the
                  pollutants in question, sampling and analyses shall be by other such procedures as
                  are required or approved by the US EPA. All self-monitoring reports must, at a minimum,
                  contain the following:

                  i.

                  The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names of the person or
                  persons taking the sample;

               Purpose. Fats, oils and grease, hereafter referred to as FOG carries the potential to create
               problems in the publicly owned treatment works. FOG can interfere with the collection
               system and with the wastewater treatment facility by plugging lines, interfering with
               pumping procedures and their controls and by contributing to a strength or form of
               waste which would be untreatable by the treatment plant. Plugged lines cause overflows
               into public domain. Such overflows are reported by the City of New Bedford to the
               Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental
               Protection Agency resulting in possible fines to the city. FOG in the treatment facilities
               causes damage to expensive equipment used in the treatment process.

               (b)

               Administration. The commissioner shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
               section.

               (c)

               Grease interceptor/grease trap general requirements.

               (1)

               The requirements in this section supplement those provided in the Massachusetts Plumbing
               Code 248 CMR 10.00, as amended.

               (2)

               Properly sized grease interceptors and/or grease traps shall be required at all food
               service facilities in the city if FOG is produced. All fixtures within such food service
               facility which may introduce FOG into the publically owned treatment works must be
               connected through the grease interceptor, including sinks, dishwashers, automatic
               hood wash units, floor drains in food preparation and storage areas, and any other
               fixture which is determined by the commissioner to be a source of FOG. Grease traps
               shall be sized according to and be compatible with the Massachusetts Plumbing Code
               248 CMR 10.00, as amended. In no case shall FOG be introduced into the publically
               owned treatment works.

               i.

               Grease interceptor installation. Grease interceptor location, design and sizing shall be based upon the requirements
               found in the Massachusetts Plumbing Code 248 CMR 10.00, as amended.

               ii.

               Existing food service facilities. Existing food service facilities that do not have a grease interceptor shall install
               a properly sized grease interceptor(s) in accordance with Massachusetts Plumbing Code.
               Plumbing connections shall be modified to accommodate the grease interceptor to comply
               with this section within one hundred-eighty (180) days from the effective date of
               this Section, unless otherwise directed by the Commissioner in writing.

               Existing Food Service Facilities that have a Grease Interceptor and are not in compliance
               with this Section shall be required to upgrade or replace the existing Grease Interceptor
               in accordance with the Massachusetts Plumbing Code within one hundred-eighty (180)
               days from the effective date of this ordinance, unless otherwise directed by the commissioner
               in writing.

               iii.

               New food service facilities. All new grease interceptors installed at food service facilities shall be of the
               type and capacity required by the Massachusetts Plumbing Code 248 CMR 10.00, as amended
               and shall be approved by the plumbing inspector. Grease Interceptors shall be installed
               and approved prior to the issuance of a building occupancy permit.

               (d)

               Grease interceptor maintenance.

               (1)

               Food service facilities with grease interceptors are required to utilize a grease
               hauler that has a valid permit to haul offal issued by the New Bedford Health Department
               to pump FOG from the grease interceptor. Any discharge, overflow or spill that leaves
               the confines of the grease interceptor and or sanitary sewer as a result of improper
               maintenance shall be classified as a pass through as defined in section 16-20 and shall result in a violation, subject to appropriate penalties, in accordance
               with section 16-34, until such a time that the situation has been corrected and clean-up process is
               underway. Furthermore, the food service establishment must notify the commissioner
               and New Bedford Health Department within twenty-four (24) hours of incident at its
               current listed telephone number and the food service facility shall submit documentation
               of pumping activities within five (5) business days to the commissioner and New Bedford
               Health Department. The food service facility shall also submit to the commissioner
               a manifest and receipt of bi-weekly inspection activities and manifests of cleaning
               activities by a permitted offal hauler for the following six (6) months.

               (2)

               In-ground grease interceptors and grease traps shall be inspected monthly by the owner/operator
               and shall be cleaned by a licensed septage hauler whenever the level of grease is
               twenty-five (25) percent of the effective depth of the trap in accordance with MA
               DEP 310 CMR 15.351. If this is not met, an increased pumping frequency shall be required.

               (3)

               The commissioner may require that, at the food service facility's expense, appropriate
               monitoring facilities, such as a control manhole, or a sampling port downstream of
               all interceptors be installed.

               (4)

               Grease interceptor cleaning and maintenance shall include pumping the grease interceptor
               until empty, and cleaning the side walls, baffle walls, cross-pipes and inlet and
               outlet pipes. Internal piping shall be immediately restored to their original design
               configuration should any damage occur. If multiple grease interceptors are installed,
               all traps in the series must be pumped according to the maintenance schedule.

               (5)

               No emulsifiers, enzymes, grease cutters or other chemicals, which could cause grease
               to pass through the grease interceptor, may be used in the maintenance of a grease
               interceptor or its drain lines. A live bacterial product, which does not contain any
               enzymes, surfactants, emulsifiers, or substances that act as solvents for fat and

               the total amount budgeted for wastewater system operation and maintained and other
               such factors as shall be necessary to establish such charges. Said charges shall be
               established to provide sufficient revenues to pay all expenses of operating and maintaining
               the wastewater works and appurtenant facilities.

               (b)

               Sewer charges shall be established, as follows:

               (1)

               A minimum charge and an annual charge based on metered water consumption for users

               discharged into its sewer system causes a significant increase in the cost of operation
               or maintenance of the sewerage system, then the costs of such increase shall be assessed

               the rate of one (1) percent per month, computed from date of mailing.

               (d)

               The public infrastructure department shall be responsible for collecting and providing
               the information necessary to allow the city council to set the annual sewer charge,
               and shall keep accurate records related thereto.

               User charge credits for extraneous water use available for owners of real estate meeting
               participation requirements are detailed below in subsection (2). Extraneous water
               use is that portion of metered water not returning to the city sewer system. Owners
               subject to such credits will be charged an administrative fee detailed in this subsection
               intended to recover the cost of administering extraneous water use credits.

               (2)

               To participate, an owner must have a licensed plumber install a ""deduct"" water meter
               of a standard approved by the city water board and commissioner of the department
               of public infrastructure to measure extraneous water use at no cost to the city. The
               owner and licensed plumber must provide certifications to the superintendent of the
               wastewater division on date of meter installation, type of meter, location of meter
               and that the meter solely measures extraneous water use. The owner must employ standard
               meter reading cards and submit meter readings on a prescribed schedule and by prescribed
               deadlines to the water department. The owner must guarantee access to deduct meters
               for unscheduled random and scheduled inspections. The owner must provide, by the fifth-year
               anniversary of meter installation and at five-year intervals thereafter, a certification
               by a licensed plumber that the deduct meter has either been replaced with a new meter
               or undergone major maintenance and recalibration; provided, however, that any such
               meter shall be placed in an area external to the user's property and shall be so situated

               source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment, and erosion and
               sedimentation associated with construction. Utilizing better site design and proper
               management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and
               private property and infrastructure, safeguard the health, safety, environment and
               general welfare of the public, protect water and aquatic resources, and promote groundwater
               recharge to protect surface and groundwater drinking supplies. This ordinance seeks
               to meet that purpose through the following objectives:

               (1)

               Establish decision-making processes surrounding land alteration activities that protect
               the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;

               (2)

               Require that new development, redevelopment and all land alteration activities maintain
               or, to the maximum extent technically feasible, restore the natural hydrologic characteristics
               of the land to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, siltation, nonpoint source pollution,
               property damage, and to improve the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;

               (3)

               Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria
               to control stormwater runoff quantity and quality;

               Establish minimum design criteria for the protection of properties and aquatic and
               groundwater resources downstream from land development and land alteration activities
               and to minimize nonpoint source pollution from stormwater runoff, which would otherwise
               degrade water quality;

               (5)

               Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural
               stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development
               stormwater management standards, as established by the Massachusetts Department of
               Environmental Protection and by Site Plan Review Requirements of the City of New Bedford
               Planning Department;

               (6)

               Encourage the use of low impact development (LID) practices that reduce runoff volume,
               such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of green space and other natural
               areas;

               (7)

               Prohibit illicit connections and illicit discharges to the municipal storm drain systems
               and require the removal of all such illicit connections;

               (8)

               Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility and maintenance of structural
               stormwater control facilities and non-structural stormwater management practices to
               ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat
               to public safety;

               (9)

               Establish provisions to ensure there is an adequate funding mechanism, including surety,
               for the proper review, inspection and long-term maintenance of stormwater facilities
               implemented as part of this ordinance;

               (10)

               Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval or disapproval
               of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects
               and long-term follow up;

               (11)

               Establish certain administrative procedures and fees for the submission, review, approval,
               or disapproval of stormwater plans, and the inspection of approved projects;

               (12)

               Establish enforcement mechanisms for failure to comply with provisions of this ordinance;
               and

               (13)

               Establish a mechanism by which the city can meet requirements of its National Pollutant
               Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from
               Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s).

               (b)

               Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance,
               rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance
               shall be considered minimum requirements and where any provision of this ordinance
               imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation
               or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher
               protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take
               precedence.

               Illicit connection: Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, which allows an illicit
               discharge to enter the municipal storm drain system, including, but not limited to,
               any conveyance which allows any non-stormwater discharge such as sewage, process wastewater
               and other wastewater products to enter the municipal storm drain system and any connections
               to the municipal storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether
               said drain or connection has been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by an
               authorized enforcement agency.

               Illicit discharge: Any direct or indirect non-stormwater discharge to the storm drain system, except
               as exempted in the stormwater rules and regulations.

               Impervious cover: Any material or structure on or above the ground that prevents water from infiltrating
               through the underlying soil. Impervious cover includes, without limitation, paved
               parking lots, sidewalks, rooftops, driveways, patios, compacted gravel, and compacted
               bare soil- surfaced roads.

               Low impact development (LID): The incorporation of non-structural and natural approaches to new and redevelopment
               projects to reduce adverse effects on water quality and the natural environment by
               conserving natural areas, reducing impervious cover, and better integrating stormwater
               treatment.

               Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards (MASWMS): The standards issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and as
               amended, that coordinate the requirements prescribed by state regulations promulgated
               under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L.A c. 131,
               § 40, Massachusetts Wetland Protection Regulations 310 CMR 10.00, and the Massachusetts
               Clean Water Act, M.G.L.A. c. 21, §§ 23—56. The standards address stormwater impacts
               through implementation of performance standards to reduce or prevent pollutants from
               reaching water bodies and control the quantity of runoff from a site.

               Municipal storm drain system: The system of conveyances designed or used for collecting or conveying stormwater,
               including any road with a drainage system, street, gutter, curb, inlet, piped storm
               drain, pumping facility, retention or detention basin, natural or man-made or altered
               drainage channel, reservoir, and other drainage structure that together comprise the
               storm drainage system owned or operated by the City of New Bedford.

               New development: Any construction or land disturbance of a parcel of land, including all projects
               requiring planning board site plan review, that is currently in a natural vegetated
               state and does not currently contain alteration by man-made activities at the location
               of the proposed land disturbance.

               Nonpoint source pollution: Pollution from many diffuse sources caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and
               through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and
               man-made pollutants, finally depositing them into water resource areas.

               Non-stormwater discharge: Discharge to the City of New Bedford municipal storm drain system not composed entirely
               of stormwater.

               Person: Includes any individual, group of individuals, association, partnership, corporation,
               company, business organization, trust, estate, the Commonwealth or political subdivision
               thereof to the extent subject to city ordinances, administrative agency, public or
               quasi-public corporation or body, the City of New Bedford, and any other legal entity,
               its legal representatives, agents, or assigns.

               any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, or container from
               which pollutants are or may be discharged.

               Post-development: The condition that reasonably may be expected or anticipated to exist after completion
               of the land development activity on a specific site or tract of land. Post-development
               refers to the phase of a new development or redevelopment project after completion,
               and does not refer to the construction phase of a project.

               Redevelopment: Any construction, alteration, or improvement on existing land that contains impervious
               cover, including all projects requiring planning board site plan review, and provided
               that the activity does not involve an increase in the net amount of impervious cover.

               Site: Any lot or parcel of land or area of property where land-disturbing activities are,
               were, or will be performed.

               Stormwater authority: The commissioner of the department of public infrastructure for the City of New Bedford

               in addition to charges for the towing and storage of the vehicle. This subsection
               shall not apply (a) if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and

               was without knowledge that said vehicle was being used in connection with a violation
               of this section.

               (2)

               Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject
               to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide
               for the towing of the vehicle to a facility designated by the city. Before or at the

               heard at the impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at
               the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the
               hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that none of the exceptions
               described in subsection (1) applies, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding
               the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the city for the three hundred
               dollar ($300.00) penalty and ordering the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
               provided in this section until the owner of the vehicle pays the three hundred dollar
               ($300.00) penalty plus all towing and storage charges allowed by law. If the owner

               order in favor of the city, requiring payment to the city of the three hundred dollar
               ($300.00) penalty and payment of all towing and storage charges allowed by law. The
               city shall send notice of the default order, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
               to the owner of record. If the hearing officer determines that no such violation occurred,
               the vehicle will be returned, upon payment of towing and storage charges allowed by
               law.

               (4)

               Unless a hearing has been held pursuant to subsection (3), within five (5) days after
               a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the city shall send notice,
               by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record of the date, time
               and location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this section. The hearing
               shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no
               later than ten (10) days after the vehicle was seized. The hearing shall be conducted

               shall not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. All interested
               persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after
               the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that
               none of the exceptions described in subsection (1) applies, the hearing officer shall
               enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the city
               for the three hundred dollar ($300.00) penalty and ordering the continued impoundment
               of the vehicle as provided in this section until the owner of the vehicle pays the
               three hundred dollar ($300.00) penalty and all towing and storage charges allowed
               by law. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer
               shall enter a default order in favor of the city requiring payment to the city of
               the three hundred dollar ($300.00) penalty and payment of all towing and storage charges
               allowed by law. The city shall send notice of the default order, by certified mail,
               return receipt requested, to the owner of record. If the hearing officer determines
               that no such violation occurred, the vehicle will be returned, upon payment of the
               towing and storage charges allowed by law.

               (5)

               If a penalty is ordered pursuant to this section, the penalty shall constitute a debt
               due and owing to the city. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle
               shall continue to be impounded until (1) the penalty is paid to the city and all towing
               and storage charges are paid, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given
               to the record owner or (2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy
               the debt due and owing to the city and any towing and storage charges allowed by law.
               If the penalty and the towing and storage charges are not paid within thirty (30)
               days after the penalty hereunder is imposed, the vehicle shall be disposed of in accordance
               with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 135.

               Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lienholder, or other person
               shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section
               until the administrative fee and other applicable charges have been paid. However,
               whenever a person with a lien or record against a vehicle impounded under this section
               has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to
               that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the city the net proceeds
               of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lienholders of record,
               up to the amount owed the city plus all towing and storage charges allowed by law.

               holder, or if the vehicle is leased, the lessee of the vehicle.

               (7)

               Fees associated with the towing and storage of vehicles under this section shall be
               governed by the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 40, § 22D.

               The hearing officer referred to in subsections (3) and (4) above, shall be a licensed
               attorney who is not an employee of the City of New Bedford.

               (9)

               If any provision or part of this section shall be found unconstitutional or outside
               the corporate powers of the City of New Bedford the remaining provisions shall continue
               in full force and effect.

               Upon reasonable belief of a police officer that a child sex offender is present in
               a child safety zone in violation of this section, the officer shall obtain from the
               suspected child sex offender his/her name, address, and telephone number. Should the

               defined in this section, then the officer shall issue a written citation that such
               individual is in violation of this section and also require that the individual leave

               Any violation of section 17-26 may be subject to criminal penalties and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction

               ($300.00). A second violation of the section shall be subject to a criminal fine of
               up to three hundred dollars ($300.00). A child sex offender commits a separate offense
               for each and every violation of this section. Except for persons who are not yet seventeen
               (17) years of age when they commit any such offense, violation of this section may
               further constitute a violation of M.G.L.A. c. 272, § 59, for which the violator is
               also subject to immediate arrest without warrant. The issuance of a citation shall

               Employees of the city, except those whose salaries and wages are set by the school
               committee, shall receive compensation conformable to and in agreement with the terms
               of duly enacted ordinances or with the provisions established by adopted schedule
               of the city council.

               (b)

               (i)

               Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19-7.1(c), an employee appointed to a position in the unit C classification and salary plan
               shall be paid at the minimum rate (step 1) for the pay grade to which the appointment
               is made. Advancement within a pay grade shall be by step rate increase upon completion
               of a satisfactory evaluation of the employee's performance, which evaluation shall
               be conducted at least annually, prior to the completion of each year of creditable
               service and the anniversary of the employee's appointment to that position (the employee's
               ""step date""); and provided further, that step advancement upon completion of one (1)
               year of creditable service shall be subject to available appropriations. Creditable
               service shall be based on a period of fifty-two (52) weeks of actual service. Nothing
               in this paragraph shall be construed to allow advancement of any, employee's compensation
               by more than one step upon completion of one (1) year of creditable service without
               authorization of the mayor and city council. No step rate increase shall be implemented
               if an employee eligible for such step rate increase receives an overall performance
               rating of ""Not Met."" Upon issuing a ""Not Met"" overall performance evaluation to a
               unit C employee, the department head, except in the case of employees who work exclusively
               for the city council, shall recommend to the mayor in writing and with reasons therefore
               and with a copy to the employee, that the employee received an overall performance
               rating of ""Not Met"" and a step rate increase is not warranted or justified upon review
               of the employee's performance. The employee shall have ten (10) days from receipt
               of said reasons to submit supplemental information to the mayor. Except in the case
               of employees who work exclusively for the city council, the mayor shall decide to
               grant or disapprove a step rate increase and said decision shall be final.

               (ii)

               In the case of employees who work exclusively for the city council, except for the
               city clerk, clerk of committees and the legislative counsel, upon issuing a ""Not Met""
               overall performance evaluation to a unit C employee, the city clerk shall make recommendation
               to the city council president in writing with reasons therefore and with a copy to
               the employee, that received an overall performance rating of ""Not Met"" and a step
               rate increase is not warranted or justified upon review of the employee's performance.
               The city council employee shall have ten (10) days from receipt of said reasons to
               submit supplemental information to the city council president who shall then decide
               to grant or disapprove the step rate increase and said decision shall be final.

               (iii)

               In the case of the city clerk and clerk of committees, the performance evaluation
               shall be completed by the city council president. Upon issuing a ""Not Met"" overall
               performance evaluation for the city clerk or clerk of committees, the city council
               president shall make recommendation to the city council in writing with reasons therefore
               and with a copy to the city clerk or clerk of committees who received an overall performance
               rating of ""Not Met"" and a step rate increase is not warranted or justified upon review
               of the employee's performance. The city clerk or clerk of committees shall have ten
               (10) days from receipt of said reasons to submit supplemental information to the city
               council that shall then decide to grant or disapprove the step rate increase and said
               decision shall be final. In the case of the legislative counsel, the annual reappointment
               shall be sufficient approval of the next step rate increase.

               (iv)

               Notwithstanding any ordinances or provisions of this Code to the contrary, no employee
               appointed to a position in the unit C classification and salary plan who was a current
               employee on October 1, 2022 shall have his or her compensation advanced to the next
               higher step from October 2, 2022 to September 30, 2023, but on October 1, 2023, all
               such employees shall advance to the next higher step, except for each such employee
               who has received an overall performance rating of ""Not Met"" pursuant to subsections
               19-7.1(b)(i), 19-7.1(b)(ii), and 19-7.1(b)(iii) of this chapter. After October 1, 2023, October 1 shall be the step date

               plan who were current employees on October 1, 2022, and subsequent step increases
               shall then occur in accordance with subsections 19-7.1(b)(i), 19-7.1(b)(ii), and 19-7.1(b)(iii) of this chapter. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow advancement
               of any such employee's compensation by more than one step from October 2, 2022 to
               October 1, 2023, or in any subsequent year, without authorization of the mayor and
               city council.

               to a new position after October 1, 2022 shall be the anniversary of the employee's
               appointment to that position in accordance with subsection 19-7.1(b)(i) of this chapter, and subsequent step increases shall then occur in accordance
               with subsections 19-7.1(b)(i), 19-7.1(b)(ii), and 19-7.1(b)(iii) of this chapter. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow advancement
               of any such employee's compensation by more than one step from October 2, 2022 to
               October 1, 2023, or in any subsequent year, without authorization of the mayor and
               city council.

               (c)

               The city council may approve, at the request of the mayor, that a salary step other
               than the minimum or a specifically defined range of salary steps along the grade for
               a particular position may be utilized during a specifically defined hiring period
               for such position, in order to negotiate the initial compensation with prospective
               candidates. No approval of a salary step or a defined range of salary steps however
               shall include a step greater than step 3 on the grade for any particular position.

               completion of a creditable year of service pursuant to subsection (b), unless the
               city council authorizes the mayor to advance an employee to a higher step.

               (d)

               Employees who have been assigned to a salary step pursuant to section 19-7(b) of this chapter, shall advance to the next higher step effective July 1, 1989,

                  the security deposit has been replenished and the city's costs in excess of the security

                  the city after three (3) years lapse from the date that the permanent pavement repair

               excavating a trench as herein provided may be revoked by the mayor and council under
               the provisions of law.

                  (1)

                  Scope. This section establishes the suspension and revocation procedures for all permits,
                  establishes the penalty structure for the assessment of administrative penalties and

                  (3)

                  Assessment of fines by the department of public safety.

                  (a)

                  (c)

                  Factors in determining amount of penalty. In determining the amount of the administrative
                  penalty, the department of public safety may consider one or more of the following:

                  1.

                  The willfulness of the violation;

                  2.

                  Previous violations resulting in the imposition of administrative penalties as set
                  forth in the rules of the department of public safety;

                  3.

                  Whether the violation resulted in an accident involving bodily injury or death to
                  a member of the general public;

                  4.

                  The actual or potential danger to the public;

                  5.

                  Whether the excavator did everything reasonable to attempt to comply with the regulation;

                  6.

                  Actions, if any, taken by the department of public infrastructure;

                  7.

                  Whether imposition of the administrative penalty is likely to deter future noncompliance;
                  and

                  8.

                  The interests of public safety.

                  (d)

                  Notice. The department of public safety shall send written notice of alleged violation(s)

                  3.

                  The amount that is to be assessed as a penalty for each alleged violation;

                  (4)

                  The failure to make a timely request for a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the
                  right to a hearing and imposition of the penalty set forth in the notice. A hearing
                  shall be commenced by the department of public safety within a reasonable period after

               No vehicle shall be licensed or operated as a class A vehicle unless and until the
               same is equipped with a taximeter.

               (b)

               The term ""taximeter"" shall mean a mechanical instrument or device by which the charge
               for hire of a class A public vehicle at a predetermined rate or rates is mechanically
               calculated and registered, either for distance traveled or for waiting time, or both,
               and upon which such charge shall be indicated by means of figures.

               (c)

               No class A vehicle shall be licensed until the taximeter attached thereto shall have
               been approved and sealed by the office of the sealer of weights and measures. After
               sundown, the face of every taximeter shall be illuminated by a suitable light so arranged
               as to throw a continuous steady light thereon. Upon an order of the chief of police
               and city clerk a licensee shall have the taximeter re-inspected.

               (d)

               Waiting time shall include all time during which the class A vehicle is not in motion,
               beginning five (5) minutes after its arrival at the place to which it has been called,
               or if engaged in the street or at a stand, beginning five (5) minutes after the time
               of such engagement. A charge as provided in subsection (j) hereof may be made, but
               no charge shall be made for time lost through the inefficiency of the vehicle or its
               driver, or for time between premature arrival in respect to a call and the hour for
               which the vehicle was ordered.

               (e)

               Each taximeter must be furnished with a tamper-proof switch and system of electrical
               distribution, so that when the taximeter flag is in the vacant or noncarrying position,
               the vacant sign on the top of the taxicab will be lighted, and when the meter flag
               is in the earning position, the fare indicator on the taximeter will be lighted.

               (f)

               Such taximeters must register upon visual counters the following items:

               (1)

               Number of extras.

               (g)

               No driver of a taxicab equipped with a taximeter while carrying passengers or under
               employment shall display the signal affixed to such taximeter in such a position as
               to denote such vehicle is not employed, or in such position to denote that the vehicle
               is employed at a rate of fare different from that to which the operator is entitled
               under the provisions of this chapter. It shall be the duty of the driver to call the
               attention of passengers to the amount registered and the taxicab flag shall not be
               changed to ""Vacant"" position until after the fare is paid. If demanded by the passenger,
               the driver in charge of a taxicab shall deliver to the person paying for the hiring
               of the same at the time of such payment a receipt therefore in legible type or writing
               containing the name of the owner, the city license number or the driver's city license
               number, or the taximeter number, and any items for which a charge is made, the total
               amount paid, and the day and time of payment.

               (h)

               No person shall drive a taxicab to which is attached a taximeter that has not been
               duly inspected and approved. It shall be unlawful to change the size of the wheels
               or tires of a taxicab or the gears operating the taximeter or to change a taximeter
               from one (1) taxicab to another unless the taximeter is retested and approved.

               (i)

               It shall be unlawful for any person owning, operating or driving a taxicab as herein
               defined to operate or drive such taxicab unless such taximeter is used in determining
               the fare to be charged and no other or different fare shall be charged to passenger
               than is recorded on the reading face of said taximeter for a trip, except that the
               hourly rate may be used at mutual agreement of passenger and owner of the taxicab.
               No other rates or methods of measuring the distance or time charges shall be allowed
               except as herein provided.

               (j)

               No taxicab license and no person in charge of or operating a taxicab shall demand,
               charge, arrange, accept or receive any rate in excess of or below the rates established
               by this chapter. The price or rates of fare which any person owning, operating or
               controlling any licensed class A public vehicle within the limits of the city may
               charge and demand and which shall be determined by a taximeter shall be:
